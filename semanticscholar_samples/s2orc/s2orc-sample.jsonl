As the primary forum for international evaluation of different biomedical event extraction technologies, BioNLP Shared Task represents a trend in biomedical text mining toward fine-grained information extraction (IE). The fourth series of BioNLP Shared Task in 2016 (BioNLP-ST'16) proposed three tasks, in which the Bacteria Biotope event extraction (BB) task has been put forward in the earlier BioNLP-ST. Deep learning methods provide an effective way to automatically extract more complex features and achieve notable results in various natural language processing tasks. Results: The experimental results show that the presented approach can achieve an F-score of 57.42% in the test set, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art official submissions to BioNLP-ST 2016. Conclusions: In this paper, we propose a novel Gated Recurrent Unit Networks framework integrating attention mechanism for extracting biomedical events between biotope and bacteria from biomedical literature, utilizing the corpus from the BioNLP'16 Shared Task on Bacteria Biotope task. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\nBackground\n\nWith the rapid development of computational and biological technology, biomedical literatures are expanding at an exponential rate, which makes it difficult to extract the required information by hand and also provides an opportunity for text mining techniques in this field. In past years, the major focus of biomedical text mining has been named entity recognition (NER), which identifies entities such as genes, proteins and drugs. Recently, text mining researchers pay more attention to complex information extraction, such as biomedical event extraction, with the appearance of applicable NER systems.\n\nAs the primary forum for international evaluation of different biomedical event extraction technologies, BioNLP Shared Task represents a trend in biomedical text mining toward fine-grained information extraction (IE). The fourth series of BioNLP Shared Task in 2016 (BioNLP-ST' 16) proposed three tasks, in which the Bacteria Biotope event extraction (BB) task has been put forward in the earlier BioNLP-ST. BB task focus on studying the interaction mechanisms of the bacteria with their environment from genetic, phylogenetic and ecology perspectives. The BB task involves three types of entities, Bacteria, Habitats and Geographical places. It also involves a single type of event, the Lives in event, which is a relation between two mandatory arguments, the bacterium and the location where it lives, either a Habitat or a Geographical entity. Fig. 1 displays an example of entities and events in the BB task.\n\nPrevious BB tasks have been raised in 2011 and 2013 with similar subtasks. Ratkovik et al.'s framework based on semantic analysis supported by an ontology of the biotope domain achieved the first place in the BioNLP-ST'11 [1]. After the BioNLP-ST'11, the BB task in the BioNLP-ST'13 introduced a same event extraction task on a new dataset [2]. Björne et al. 's system was the best system in BioNLP-ST'13, which adopted support vector machine (SVM) and extracted a wide array of features based on dependency parse graphs, achieving an F-score of 42% on the test datasets [3]. In the BioNLP-ST'16, team VERSE obtaining the 1st place in BB-event subtask utilized SVM and achieved an F-score of 55.8% [4]. The methods mentioned above for BB event extraction are based on shallow machine learning methods, which utilized commonly used features and achieved good results.\n\nRecently, deep learning methods provide an effective way to automatically extract more complex features and achieve notable results in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Zhang proposed a bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BLSTM) to model the sentence with complete, sequential information about all words for relation classification [5]. Jagannatha adopted original sentences as the input of LSTM and GRU, and the results showed that LSTM and GRU are valuable tools for extracting medical events in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes [6]. Team TurkuNLP used a combination of several LSTM networks over syntactic dependency graphs, which achieved an F-score of 52.1% in BB-event subtask in the BioNLP-ST'16 [7]. Team DUTIR employed convolutional neural network (CNN) to model the sentences by convolution and maxpooling operation from raw input with word embeddings and used fully connected neural network to learn senior and significant features automatically, which reached 47.8% F-score [8]. Li proposed a bidirectional LSTM-based recurrent neural network and a dynamic extended tree was introduced as the input, which achieved an F-score of 57.14% [9]. After that, Li utilized the predictions of SVM for post-processing, which reached 58.09% F-score [10]. However, all words are equally important in these approaches, which leads to the failure to capture the most important semantic information in a sentence.\n\nAttention mechanism has been introduced to the NLP task to capture the semantic attention and promote the performance of a variety of task, which has recently succeeded in a variety of tasks ranging from machine translations [11], speech recognition [12], to image captioning [13]. Zhou et al. [14] presented an attention-based bilingual representation learning model which learned the documents in both the source and the target languages and a hierarchical attention mechanism for the bilingual LSTM network. Zhou et al. [15] proposed Attention-Based Bidirectional LSTM to handle the relation classification on the SemEval-2010 task. In this paper, we propose an attention-based BGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) network architecture for the Bacteria Biotope event extraction. The BGRU networks as a deep learning framework can reduce the number of handcrafted features and overcome the problems above. Furthermore, the attention mechanism can take advantage of the important information in the sentence and make the semantic information more precise.\n\nDeep-learning methods are representation-learning methods, by which deep learning framework can perform well. Mikolov et al. [16,17] proposed two efficient models, continuous bag-of-words model (CBOW) and skip-gram model, to learn word embeddings from large-scale text corpora. The above models are designed with general-purpose, usually trained on Wikipedia and evaluated on word analogy tasks. However, the experimental evidence shows that domain irrelevant word embeddings trained on large collections of texts are not good enough for biomedical domain NLP, biomedical-oriented word embeddings can outperform general-purposed ones, and further improve the performance of biomedical NLP systems. Therefore, we utilize a biomedical domain-specific word representation model, which integrates biomedical information into word embeddings.\n\nIn conclusion, the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows:\n\nWe propose an attention-based BGRU network architecture for the Bacteria Biotope event extraction. Compared to the previous methods which cannot capture the important information, the attention mechanism has obvious advantage to put greater weight to the useful information, which enables our model to focus on certain part of the input. In addition, the deep learning method used in our model, BGRU networks, avoids extracting the manual features. A domain-oriented word representation is employed in our model. Because biomedical text has many domain-specific features that should be taken into consideration, such as special characters in gene sequences and widely existed biomedical entities, we consider biomedical text as a sequence of words, syntactic chunks and biomedical entities and incorporate them into word embeddings.\n\n[Bacteria]\n\n[Bacteria] M. agassizii and M. Testudineum are present in Lives_in Georgia populations of gopher tortoises.\n\n[Geographical] [Habitat] The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section II detailed illustrates the proposed method. Section III presents the experimental results. Section IV and section V discusses and concludes our paper.\n\n\nMethods\n\nWe explore an attention-based BGRU network architecture for the Bacteria Biotope event extraction, in which the attention mechanism and distributed representation for biomedical domain are introduced. The system framework for event extraction can be generalized in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, the model proposed in this paper contains five components and we will take the instance \"The effects of drinking a fermented milk beverage that contains Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) at 40 billion bacterial cells/bottle for 4 weeks (probiotics, 1 bottle/day) on defecation frequency, intestinal microbiota and the intestinal environment of healthy individuals with soft stools were evaluated.\" to demonstrate our work:\n\n1. Input layer: After the replacement of two entities, the sentence become \"The effects of drinking a fermented milk beverage that contains Lactobacillus casei strain entity_1 ( LcS) at 40 billion bacterial cells / bottle for 4 weeks ( probiotics , 1 bottle / day) on defecation frequency , intestinal microbiota and the intestinal environment of healthy individuals with soft entity_2 were evaluated. \" . We obtain the Shortest Path enclosed Tree (SPT) between two entities by GENIA Dependency parser (GDep) [18] to get the informative words. So the instance becomes \"(ROOT (FRAG (NP (NNP entity_1)) (PP (IN at) (NP (NN environment))) (PP (IN with) (NP (NNP entity_2)))))\". In order to obtain more information, the SPT is extended to the dynamic extended tree (DET) [19]. Therefore, we can get the instance \"(ROOT (SINV (VP (VBZ contains)) (NP (NP (NNP entity_1)) (PP (IN at) (NP (NP (NN environment)) (PP (IN with) (NP (NNP entity_2))))))))\".  [20]. Thus the DET is mapped to embeddings. 3. BGRU layer: The hidden layer is acquired by a recurrent neural network with attention-based BGRU. BGRU networks pick up the information from forwards and backwards of the sentence respectively. 4. Attention layer: A weight vector could learn word features automatically and record the significant information in a sentence. A sentence feature can be represented by multiplying the weight vector. 5. Output layer: We predict the label for classification by a softmax function. So we can predict whether there is an interaction between the entities \"entity_1\" and \"entity_2\".\n\nIn the following sections, we present the implementation for these stages in our biomedical event extraction system in detail and evaluate our system on the BioNLP-ST'16 BB-event datasets.\n\n\nA. Word representation\n\nDistributed representations of words in a vector space have achieved great success in NLP tasks by grouping similar words. The basic idea of distributed representation is that vectors are trained by surrounding words. However, many biomedical entities and syntactic chunks, which contain rich domain information in biomedical text mining, are not considered. In this paper, we utilize our domain-oriented word representation model to train word embeddings, which incorporates domain information such as biomedical entities. The dataset downloaded from PubMed is used to train word embeddings.\n\nFirstly, we use GDep which is more suitable for biomedical corpus to extract the following biomedical information including stem, chunk, entity and part-of-speech tags.\n\n\nStem\n\nWe take the input sentence \"contains [bacterium] e1 at environment with [human] e2 \" as an example. Although we all know that \"contains\" is the plural form of \"contain\", machines do not realize it. Instead, machines regard \"contain\" and \"contains\" as two totally different tokens. Considering stem can solve the problem.\n\n\nChunk\n\nOnly considering words and stems may be not enough. If there are modifiers in front of \"bacterium\", all modifiers of \"bacterium\" should be considered as a whole. Therefore, considering syntactic chunks is essential.\n\n\nEntity\n\nEntity is the result of named entity recognition, which provides information on biological entities and fine-grained understanding of biomedical text.\n\n\nPOS tags\n\nPOS reflects the role of words in a sentence, which is important for the analysis of sentence structure. So we use the POS to train embeddings for gaining more information.\n\nThen embeddings are trained by surrounding words and their biomedical information extracted by GDep.\n\nFinally, we can acquire word embeddings and POS embeddings.\n\nIn our system, three types of embeddings are concatenated to compose our representation of the input, whose dimension is defined as d w . Three types of embeddings are described as follows:\n\n\nWord embeddings and POS embeddings\n\nIn our experiment, word embeddings are trained by domain-oriented word representation. In addition, our POS tags are parsed in NLTK parser which is a coarse-grained POS category. e.g., \"pos:NN\", etc. The training method of POS embeddings is similar to the word embeddings and both of them are obtained by lookup tables.\n\n\nDistance embeddings\n\nAccording to the corpus analysis, we find that the entity pair is more likely to constitute an event if the distance (the number of words) between the two entities is short. For this purpose, Zeng et al. [20] proposed the use of distance embeddings (position features) which helped the CNN by the distance embeddings. In this work we also experiment with the distance embeddings. The distance embeddings are derived from the relative distances of the current word to the target \"bacterium\" and \"human\". For instance, in the sentence shown above, the relative distances of \"at\" to \"bacterium\" and \"human\" are \"-1\" and \"3\", respectively. Each relative distance is mapped to a vector of settled dimension. Each dimension d(l) of the distance embeddings is initialized with eq. (1),\nd l ð Þ ¼ tanh l=s ð Þð1Þ\nwhere the relative distance is l. s refers to the maximum of the relative distances in the corpus. d(l) is copied many times, which are equal to settled dimension. Suppose the vectors d 1 and d 2 represent the distance embeddings of the current word to the targets \"bacterium\" and \"human\" respectively, the distance embeddings d t of the current word w is given by the concatenation of these two vectors, d t = [d 1 ;d 2 ].\n\n\nB. GRU\n\nThe gated recurrent unit (GRU) [21] adaptively remembers and forgets its state based on the input signal to the unit. We also explore the more complex LSTM but it performs similarly and is more computationally expensive. A standard architecture of GRU is shown in Fig. 3.\n\nWe will describe how the activation of the j-th hidden unit is computed. Firstly, at time-step t, the GRU units can ignore whenever the detected feature is not necessary anymore considering the previous hidden states and the current input by using the reset mechanism with eq. (2).\nr j ¼ σ W r x ½ j þ U r h t−1 h i Â Ã j ;ð2Þ\nwhere σ is the logistic sigmoid function, and [.] j denotes the j-th element of a vector. h t-1 is the state of the previous step and x is the current input. Then the new candidate memory contenth t is computed considering the reset gate r j with eq. (3).\nh t h i j ¼ tanh Wx ½ j þ U r⊙h t−1 h i À Á Â Ã j ;ð3Þ\nwhere ⊙ is an element-wise multiplication. Then the update gate z j controls how much of the previous memory content is to be forgotten and how much of the new memory content is to be added with eq. (4):\nz j ¼ σ W z x ½ j þ U z h t−1 h i Â Ã j :ð4Þ\nFinally, the new memory state is obtained through the update mechanism as eq. (5).\nh t h i j ¼ z j h t−1 h i j þ 1−z j À Áh t h i j ;ð5Þ\nwhere W r , U r , W, U, W z , U z are weight matrices which are learned.\n\n\nC. BGRU\n\nOne shortcoming of unidirectional GRU is that it is only able to utilize the previous context. BGRU can solve this by processing the data in both directions with two separate hidden layers, which are then fed forwards to the same output layer. As shown in Fig. 2, the BGRU network contains two sub-networks for the left and right sequence context. Let D be a matrix consisting of output vectors [h 1 , h 2 , ..., h n ] that the final hidden state of the forward GRU and the backward GRU produced, where D∈ℝ d w Ân and n is the sentence length. The outputs of these subnets for the word at time t are integrated in the following way with eq. (6):\nD ¼ D t h i f þ D t h i b 2 ;ð6Þ\nwhere f and b refer to the forward and backward directions respectively.\n\n\nD. Attention\n\nAccording to the analysis of corpus, different words in a sentence usually have different influence in the overall semantic information. Some words can be decisive while the others are irrelevant. Thus we try to find the important units in the sequence influential for the output, which can be achieved by attention mechanism.\n\nIn this study, we propose the attention mechanism for BB event extraction. We use attention mechanism that assigns greater weight to the more important words, which makes the semantic information be fully used. For a sentence including n words, w i and m i denote i-th word and its attention weight respectively. Attention weights are normalized which satisfy the eq. (7):\nX i m i ¼ 1:ð7Þ\nTraditional GRU based models represent the word sequences only using the hidden layer D at the final node. However, in our model, the hidden states at all the positions are considered with different attention weights in order to focus on some certain parts of the sentence and filter out the irrelevant semantic noise.\n\nFirstly, we utilize the activation function tanh to handle the final state D of the GRU with eq. (8):\nH ¼ tanh D ð Þ:ð8Þ\nThen, we introduce parameter vector p which is randomly initialized. The vector's transpose is p T and the dimension is d w to train and predict the attention weights with eqs. (9) and (10): \nm ¼ p T H;ð9Þm i ¼ expm i ð Þ X i expm i ð Þð10Þ\nLet α be a vector consisting of numbers [m 1 , m 2 , …, m n ], called attention vector.\n\nThe representation r of the sentence is formed by a weighted sum of these output vectors (11):\nr ¼ Dα T ;ð11Þ\nwhere the dimension of r is d w .\n\nAt last, we obtain the overall semantic information of the sentence used for classification from eq. (12):\no ¼ tanh r ð Þð12Þ\n\nResults\n\n\nA. Corpus and evaluation\n\nThe dataset is provided by the Bacteria Biotope event extraction task of BioNLP-ST'16, which is a subset of a corpus of 1.16 million PubMed references and the manual annotation of bacteria and habitats was performed by Bibliome group. In our work, we only consider relations within sentences. All experiments are evaluated with online evaluation. The evaluation method is the matching similarity. Namely, if the Bacteria argument in the reference and the prediction events are the same entity or equivalent entities, and the Location argument in the reference and the prediction events are the same entity or equivalent entities then the matching similarity is 1, otherwise 0. The results are measured using Recall, Precision and F-score. The definition of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-score (F) are shown as eq. (13):\nP ¼ TP TP þ FP ; R ¼ TP TP þ FN ; F−score ¼ 2 Ã P Ã R P þ R :ð13Þ\nwhere TP is short for true positives, FP represents false positives, and FN stands for false negatives. Any cross-sentence relations in the test data count against the submission as false negatives.\n\n\nB. Hyper parameters and training details\n\nThis subsection presents the hyper parameter tuning for our model. The dimensions of word embeddings, POS embeddings and distance embeddings are set as 50. We use unlabeled corpus downloaded from PubMed to train word representation, which consists of 5.99 million words. The initial word embeddings are trained by setting the windows to be 5 and learning rate to be 0.025. The dropout rate is set to be 0.5 to prevent overfitting. As it is not feasible to perform a full grid search for all hyper parameters, the above values are chosen empirically. The existing training/dev split for the data is used in the paper. Referring to Mehryary's [7] discussion with regard to the challenge of deep learning methods on a small test set, where the optimal length of training is four epochs by the experiment, the number of iterations in our model is set between three and five. The \"learning rate\" is set to 10 − 3 , which is chosen by validation from the set {10 − 2 , 10 − 3 , 10 − 4 }. The dropout method is tried to apply on the hidden state of the forward GRU, the hidden state of the backward GRU and the final hidden state of the GRU. Finally, the dropout method is applied on the final hidden state of the GRU. The \"batch_size\" is set to 5 and the number of layers is 1. The parameters mentioned above are set from development set. We implement the framework based on Theano [22] and use a GTX TITAN graphic card for training. Table 1 compares the performance among our system, the baseline and other excellent systems. The baseline was implemented based on Björne al.'s (2013) paper. Compared to baseline, the precision of our system is not better than the baseline, however, the recall is 31.47 percentage points higher than the baseline. From Table 1 we can see that the F-score of our system is 10.15 percentage points higher than the baseline system. The reason is that the Björne's system was characterized by a wide array of features based on dependency parse graphs, therefore it achieved the higher precision. However, the recall was not satisfactory and it illustrates that excessive manual efforts may hurt the generalization performance.\n\n\nC. Baselines and results\n\nThe best system in BioNLP-ST'16 is the VERSE, obtaining the 1st place in BB-event subtask, achieved an F-score of 55.8%. VERSE offered control on the exact semantic features to use for classification and allowed feature selection to reduce the size of feature vectors. Although our system is only 1.62 percentage points higher than it, we need not spend a lot of energy to select handcrafted features.\n\nTeam TurkuNLP used a combination of several LSTM networks over syntactic dependency graphs, which achieved 52.1% F-score and obtained the 2nd place in BB-event subtask in the BioNLP-ST'16. Li [9] proposed a bidirectional LSTM-based recurrent neural network and used a dynamic extended tree as the input, which achieved an F-score of 57.14%. Li's [10] method outperforms ours because their system used two classifiers and improved the precision. However, their model treated all words equally and could not capture the decisive information. Our approach integrates attention mechanism, which gives different words different weights. So, the important words are emphasized. The results indicate the effectiveness of our method.\n\n\nD. Influence of the attention mechanism\n\nIn this study, we propose an attention mechanism to capture the related semantic information of each word.\n\nIn Table 2, we show the results of models with attention mechanisms. The models are based on the bi-directional GRU network as shown in Fig. 2. BGRU is the basic bi-directional GRU network without attention mechanism. From the results, we can observe that BGRU+Attention outperforms well, whose F-score is 1.06 percentage points higher than the BGRU model, which proves the effectiveness of the attention mechanism.\n\n\nE. Influence of the word Embeddings\n\nFor the deep learning methods, the initial word embeddings used as the inputs for the network usually play an important role in models. We compare the domain-oriented method and the skip-gram model to train word embeddings. All parameters described in the previous section are set the same. The performance on the BB-event task for two kinds of word vectors are shown in Table 3. From the results, we can see that the F-score of our domain-oriented method is 1.45 percentage points higher than the skip-gram model, which proves that incorporating biomedical information is beneficial to embeddings.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom the above experimental results, we can conclude that our BGRU model based on attention mechanism performs well and mainly includes the following important advantages:\n\nNo complex hand-designed features and using domainoriented word embeddings\n\nWe skip the step of extracting complex hand-designed features, only adopt simple POS and distance features, and replace it with word embeddings trained beforehand. Since the domain-oriented word embeddings can catch a large number of syntactic and semantic word relationships and also capture biomedical information, the deep learning architecture can fully utilize them and extract the high-level features for the BB-event systems.\n\n\nAttention mechanism\n\nAll hidden states are treated equally before using an attention mechanism, which is not reasonable. Some words in a sentence play a decisive role, thus a higher weight should be given to make judgments more accurate, which can be well implemented by an attention mechanism. The experimental results also reveal that our attention mechanism is effective.\n\n\nEffective GRU framework\n\nThe results show that our GRU framework is effective in features detection and propagation. This is mainly because that the proposed attention mechanism, our selected embeddings and structure of GRU are suitable for BB-event.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we propose an attention-based BGRU network architecture for the Bacteria Biotope event extraction. We improve the model by utilizing attention mechanism. Simultaneously, the word embeddings for biomedical domain are added into the bidirectional GRU to obtain more abundant contextual information. The experimental results show that our model on BB-event corpus can achieve an F-score of 57.42% without using complex hand-designed features and external resource, which is 1.62 percentage points higher than the best systems. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed framework. However, there are still spaces for improvement. For example, coreference resolution can be used to find more events.   \n\nFig. 1\n1Example of entities and Lives in events in the BB task. \"Georgia\" is the entity of [Geographical]; \"populations of gopher tortoises\" is the entity of [Habitat]; \"M. agassizii\" and \"M.

Shandong Province, in northern China, is located on the migration pathway of WBPH between southern and northeast China. The potential sources of WBPH in northern China are poorly understood. We studied the sources of WBPH in Shandong Province by determining the population genetic structure of WBPH in 18 sites distributed in Shandong and in six regions of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). We used mitochondrial gene and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for analysis.Results: All of the WBPH populations studied in the seven regions had low genetic diversity. Pairwise F ST values based on mtDNA ranged from − 0.061 to 0.285, while F ST based on SNP data ranged from − 0.007 to 0.009. These two molecular markers revealed that 4.40% (mtDNA) and 0.19% (SNP) genetic variation could be explained by the interpopulation variation, while the rest came from intrapopulation variation. The populations in the seven geographic regions comprised four hypothetical genetic clusters (K = 4) not associated with geographic location. Eightyfour of 129 individuals distributed across the given area were designated as recent migrants or of admixed ancestry. Although the substantial migration presented, a weak but significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances was found (r = 0.083, P = 0.004).Conclusion:The Greater Mekong Subregion was the main genetic source of WBPH in Shandong, while other source populations may also exist. The genetic structure of WBPH is shaped by both migration and geographic barriers. These results help clarify the migration route and the source of WBPH in northern China.\n\nwas conducted in China. It was found that the spring migrants of WPBH were from the Indochina Peninsula, and they migrated into southern China [3]. The WBPH that migrated to China continue to move toward northern China on prevailing winds [4,5]. Based on trajectory analysis, the rice paddy fields in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and parts of Yunnan Province in China, are considered to be important overwintering sites [6,7]. Molecular marker data have confirmed that the extensive gene flow of WBPH occurs between Yunnan Province and neighboring countries in the GMS [8,9].\n\nShandong Province in China is a typical region for growing single and midseason rice. Rice growing areas in Shandong Province are important because they are on the migration path of WBPH between southern and northeast China. Trajectories analysis demonstrated that some WBPH individuals migrating into China can reach northeastern China by late June or early July. The WBPH can then move between the Shandong and Liaoning provinces (or the Korean Peninsula) in both directions [4,5]. The genetic background and detailed information of the potential source of WBPH in Shandong remain unclear.\n\nPrevious studies on WBPH migration mainly depended on the trajectory analysis method [4,10]. Recently, molecular markers have been used for genetic studies of WBPH. These have included mitochondrial DNA genes (mtCOI) and nuclear genes (microsatellites) [8,11,12]. High-throughput sequencing of 2b-restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) is available, and this can be used to scan the entire genome and identify large numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [13]. This can help precisely evaluate the population differentiation among various geographic populations [14] and can determine disturbances of population structure caused by immigration [15].\n\nIn this study, we used both mitochondrial DNA and genome SNP markers to analyze the genetic diversity and connectivity of WBPH populations in seven geographic regions in Shandong Province, China and the GMS, including Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Vietnam, and Yunnan Province. We characterized the genetic differentiation among WBPH populations and identified the possible source populations of WBPH in Shandong Province.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nGenetic diversity\n\nA total of 663 bases in the mtDNA COI genes from 133 individuals (deposited in GenBank under Accession Nos. MN718018-MN718150) were obtained. Of the 663 sites, 653 were conserved, and 10, including nine singleton polymorphic sites and one parsimonious informative site, were variable. Of the 133 samples, 11 haplotypes were identified ( Fig. 1, Table 1), of which nine were unique haplotypes and two were shared between populations. These two shared haplotypes (H1 and H2) accounted for 93.2% of the total haplotype frequency. The WBPH populations showed moderately low haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity. The overall haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity were 0.453 and 0.00077, respectively (Table 1).\n\nAt SNP markers, all populations departed significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to a heterozygosity deficit (all P < 0.001). The observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.181 in Shandong (CN_SD) to 0.227 in Yunnan (CN_YN). The unbiased expected heterozygosity (uH E ) values ranged from 0.227 in Myanmar (MM) to 0.272 in Shandong (CN_SD) ( Table 2).\n\n\nPopulation structure\n\nPairwise F ST values computed from mtDNA data ranged from − 0.061 to 0.285, with an average F ST of 0.098. Permutation tests showed that P value of F ST were significant between CN_SD and Thailand population (TH) (P < 0.001), as well as between CN_YN and TH (P = 0.045) ( Table 3). The haplotype network obviously displayed a two-star pattern with the common haplotype (H1 and H2) in the center of the two stars (Fig. 1). The F ST values among populations represented in the Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that the TH was separated from the other populations (Fig. 2a).\n\nPairwise F ST values computed over SNP loci were quite low, ranging from − 0.007 to 0.009, with an average F ST of 0.002. Pairwise F ST value (0.009) between CN_SD and CN_YN was significant (P < 0.05) ( Table 3). The PCoA result showed that 100% of the variation was explained by the first two axes. The first axis of the PCoA separated CN_SD and CN_YN (Fig. 2b).\n\nThe results of the AMOVA test on mtDNA and SNP markers in different populations are shown in Table 3. The global AMOVA of the data for the two molecular markers revealed that 4.40% (mtDNA) and 0.19% (SNP) genetic variation could be explained by the variation among populations, whereas the remainder came from variation within populations. Because of the low sample size in the Thailand population (TH), we reanalyzed global AMOVA excluding TH, and found no significant variation among the remaining populations. Based on the results of pairwise F ST , we set the group = 2, which considered CN_SD as one group and the other populations as another group. Significant variability was found among SNP between these two groups (0.96%, P < 0.05) ( Table 4).\n\nWe also analyzed the population genetic structure based on SNP data using STRU CTU RE software. The STRU CTU RE analyses suggested that WBPH most likely forms four genetic clusters (Fig. 3). Indeed, for K = 4, the log-likelihood of the multilocus genotypic data was maximal and had low variance (Additional file 1: Figure S1). These clusters were not dependent on geographic regions because each population had the four genetic clusters, indicating a high level of gene flow.\n\n\nPopulation assignment and isolation by distance\n\nBased on population assignment test of the SNP data, 84 individuals were identified as migrants, there were connections among the Shandong population and other populations, all of which were expected to be a possible source of the Shandong population (Table 5). There were  also frequent migrations among the Yunnan population and Southeast Asian populations. It is plausible that a high dispersal rate exists in Yunnan and Southeast Asia areas. However, migrants mainly moved from Yunnan population to the Southeast Asia areas populations. In our mtDNA sequence data set, no isolation by distance (IBD) effects were detected with the standardized pairwise F ST (r = − 0.028, P = 0.085; Fig. 4a). In contrast, there was a weak but significant IBD effect across the seven geographic regions in the SNP data (r = 0.083, P = 0.004; Fig. 4b).\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nGenetic diversity of WBPH\n\nThe analysis based on the mitochondrial gene (COI) showed that all of the WBPH populations have relatively low genetic diversity. Only two dominant COI haplotypes widely exist in all populations suggesting a high-level gene flow among them. Among the 11 COI haplotypes identified, four haplotypes, including the two dominant haplotypes, were also found by previous study [8]. The number of haplotypes was much lower than the previous study [8] which found more rare haplotypes; it may be due to the difference in sampling size. Our study results demonstrate that the haplotype diversity was lower in Shandong Province than that in the GMS, which may be \n\n\nTable 3 Pairwise F ST values based on mtDNA (above diagonal) and those based on SNP (below diagonal)\n\nIn bold significant values (P < 0.05)  Fig. 1 a consequence of founder events during migration. This result is consistent with that of [16] who demonstrated that range expansion can reduce genetic diversity in a long-distance migratory species.\nLA MM TH KH VN CN_YN CN_SD LA − 0.022 0.140 − 0.045 − 0.061 − 0.032 − 0.014 MM − 0.001 0.251 − 0.057 − 0.028 − 0.019 − 0.040 TH − 0.003 0.002 0.218 0.147 0.211 0.285 KH − 0.001 − 0.001 0.000 − 0.055 − 0.040 − 0.052 VN 0.001 0.005 − 0.001 0.003 − 0.045 − 0.023 CN_YN − 0.001 0.002 0.000 0.003 0.002 − 0.014 CN_SD 0.001 0.004 − 0.007 − 0.\nThe genome SNP markers (2b-RAD) analysis showed that a heterozygosity deficit existed in all populations. This result may be explained by demographic expansion, and it is consistent with [9] who also found that WBPH had a heterozygosity deficit during expansion. These findings suggest that WBPH may have non-random mating and intense migration in the sampled populations. With regard to spatial genetic variations, geographic factors play a weak role in WBPH populations. The AMOVA result indicated that there is only 4.40% (mtDNA) and 0.19% (SNP) genetic variation when all of the samples were grouped based on the geographic criteria. These results confirmed previous findings that WBPH migrates between the counties in GMS and China [9].\n\n\nPopulation genetic structure of WBPH\n\nThe mtDNA and SNP data revealed different patterns of genetic connectivity among the WBPH populations (Table 3, Fig. 2). The main differences between markers concerned the genetic structure within the populations in Thailand and Shandong, where mtDNA clearly differentiated the Thailand population from the other populations, while SNP data separated the Shandong   Fig. 1 population from Yunnan population (Fig. 2). Because mtDNA is sensitive to founder effects and small population size, the probable loss or gain of a mtDNA haplotype will be greater for small populations, and it is often used to indicate migration among populations [17]. Based on the results of mtDNA, Shandong had close connectivity with the GMS. Therefore, it seems that the populations in Shandong may have come from the GMS. SNP data provided information about the genetic structure of WPBH populations. Genetic connectivity among the GMS populations and Shandong population was close. Most of migrants were from Yunnan population as showed by results of population assignment. Compared with the mtDNA data, the SNP data were more consistent with the IBD pattern, perhaps as a result of high information of SNPs. Besides, mtDNA is often unsuitable for detecting isolation by distance [18]. This finding is consistent with the results of [19] who determined the effects of geographic isolation on the genetic structure of WBPH populations in Asia using microsatellite markers. A possible explanation for this might be that WBPH appears to have a stepwise migration. For example, it migrates from Southeast Asian areas into southern China, and then the second or later generations continue to move northward. Both genetic drift and local adaptation may influence the genetic variations of WBPH. As a consequence, geographic barriers and migration probably acted together to shape the genetic structure of WBPH.\n\nIn this study, the SNP markers showed that all of the populations exhibit high levels of admixture between the clusters identified with STRU CTU RE. This indicates the occurrence of long distance migration events within geographical regions. Long-distance migration of WBPH allowed genetic mixing between populations from remote geographical origins [20]. This pattern may be common in other migratory insects, such as Helicoverpa spp. [21]. A population assignment test using the firstgeneration migrant detection method revealed Yunnan as the main source of WBPH in Shandong following by other areas in the GMS (Table 5). Our results also showed that the migrants moved from Yunnan to the Southeast Asian areas. Because of our sampling set, the sampling period in Yunnan (May) was two months later than in the Southeast Asian areas (March). It is impossible for the sampled Yunnan population move to the Southeast Asian areas. Therefore, Yunnan would probably supply migrants to the Southern Asian areas during autumn or winter. Regarding the bigger sample size in Yunnan than any other populations, we randomly sub-selected 20 individuals of Yunnan to repeat the assignment test. The\n\n\nTable 5 Assignment test for Sogatella furcifera individuals in the seven geographic regions\n\nIndividuals are presented in rows according to their sampling locations as individuals assigned to their own population (self ) and those assigned to other putative source population\n\n\nPopulation\n\nSelf Putative source population  result was much the same, although some details were different (Additional file 1: Table S1). The major migration routes of WBPH in East Asia were illustrated by [1] who reviewed previous studies of trajectory analyses. From mid-June to July, WBPH migrate from southern China to paddy fields in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, western Japan, and Korea. Because information on the migration of WBPH in Shandong is limited, many trajectory analysis and migration simulation usually neglect this area. Our results provide useful data for the migration route and source of WBPH in Shandong, which provide a better understanding of its migration routes. We inferred that WBPH in Shandong represents an important migration station. In this area, WBPH can establish connections with populations in Liaoning (North China) and Korea.\nLA MM TH KH VN CN_YN CN_SD LA 0 - - 1 - - 18 - MM 2 - - - - - 14 - TH 0 - 1 - - - 6 - KH 0 1 2 - - - 9 - VN 0 - - 1 - - 13 - CN_YN 43 - - - - - - - CN_SD 0 1 1 3 1 - 12 - y = -0.0171x\n\nDispersal of WBPH in China\n\nWeather conditions are thought to expedite long-distance immigration of planthoppers [22]. In southern China, early season rice is planted in late March or early April. WBPH migrates into this area from Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand [3]. From May to June, WBPHs continually migrate into the Yangtzi River Valley. However, during this period, the emigration of WBPH in southern China is often hindered by heavy precipitation in southern China [23]. Because the migration of WBPH mainly depends on seasonal weather systems, WBPHs cannot migrate further north before mid-June [23]. Based on these data, we infer that the northward migration of WBPH during June and July largely contributes to the populations in the Shandong area.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study demonstrated that WBPH populations have a low level of genetic diversity and a mixed genetic structure. We arranged the samples in chronological order, which depended on the occurrence of WBPH. Rice planting in Shandong mainly begins in May, and the WBPHs often have population outbreaks in July and August. Although the GMS were revealed as the main genetic source of WBPH in Shandong, WBPHs expand their range in a stepwise manner. Populations reproducing in other areas of China, such as Yangtze River Valley, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region, and Guizhou Province, may also be important sources. Future study is needed to examine more geographic populations and understand the temporal and spatial genetic structure of WBPH in China.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nInsect samples\n\nWBPH individuals were sampled in various geographic regions (China and Southeast Asia) ( Table 6, Fig. 1). These comprised six sites in Yunnan Province; four sites in Shandong Province; two sites in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, respectively; and one site in Myanmar and Thailand, respectively ( Table 6). The sample size ranged \n\n\n2b-RAD sequencing and genotyping\n\nThe 2b-RAD sequencing and genotyping were outsourced to Shanghai OE Biotech Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Libraries were constructed following the 2b-RAD protocol [13]. Briefly, library preparation began with digestion of DNA samples. The BsaXI restriction enzyme (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was used to prepare RAD libraries. Next, library-specific adaptors and the digestion products were linked with T4 DNA ligase. Ligation products were amplified by PCR, and the target band was excised from a 2% agarose gel. Finally, the paired-end RAD tags were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq Xten platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Quality filtering was conducted as follows: raw reads were trimmed to remove adaptors, and the terminal 2-bp positions were discarded to eliminate artifacts that might have arisen by ligation. Ambiguous bases (N) or reads of low quality (> 10 bp with quality less than Q20) were removed. SNPs were determined, and genotypes were called using a maximum-likelihood statistical model implemented in the software Stacks v1.32 [27].\n\n\nGenetic variation analysis based on mitochondrial data\n\nNumbers and distribution of haplotypes, composition of haplotypes in each population, numbers of unique haplotypes, within-population mean number of pairwise differences, and nucleotide diversity were assessed using DnaSP v.5.10 [28].The statistical parsimony network (also known as the TCS network) of haplotypes was analyzed using Popart ver. 1.7 [29,30].\n\n\nGenetic variation analysis based on SNP data\n\nThe genotype data contained information for each locus and each individual. The primary SNP loci number was 13,565, which could genotype all 133 individuals. We used Plink version 1.07 [31] to filter SNPs for genetic analysis. SNPs were filtered to meet the following criteria: (a) SNPs that were included in at least 80% samples of a population, (b) SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) higher than 0.05, and (c) loci with strong deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE, P < 0.0001) were removed. We excluded four samples which were from Shandong population that had too many missing data from further analyses reducing our sample size to 129 individuals. The final filtered SNP dataset had 1,108 SNP loci and was used for all downstream analyses. The parameters for population genetic analyses, that is, percentage of polymorphic loci (%poly), Shannon's information index (I), observed heterozygosity (H O ), unbiased expected heterozygosity (uH E ), and fixation index (F), were estimated by using GenALEx 6.5 [32,33]. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), heterozygosity excess and deficit were tested by GENEPOP version 4.2.1 [34].\n\n\nPopulation structure\n\nWe evaluated population genetic structure using five different approaches: (i) measuring genetic differentiation (F ST ) among populations, (ii) Principle Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) (iii) hierarchical analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), (iv) Bayesian model-based clustering, and (v) Isolation by distance (IBD). For mtDNA data, the pairwise F ST were calculated using Arlequin v.3.5.1.2 [35] and using the Tamura-Nei model [36]. For SNP data, the pairwise F ST were calculated using GenALEx. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was used to find and plot the major pattern within a genetic distance matrix dataset. The PCoA using GenALEx, performed on genetic distance, was used to display genetic divergence among the populations. To determine the proportion of genetic variation that could be attributed to differences between sampling sites, hierarchal analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs) were performed. A hierarchical AMOVA was performed using Arlequin, with 1000 permutations. Populations were grouped corresponding to two major criteria, i.e., geographical area, and population genetic structure, to test genetic homogeneity in different hierarchies.\n\nThe Bayesian approach was used to determine genetically distinct groups (or clusters) using the program STRU CTU RE v.2.3.1 [37][38][39][40]. We set the length of the Burnin period at 10,000 and number of MCMC Reps after Burniin was 20,000. We set the K value from 1 to 7 and for each K the number of iterations was 10. To estimate the group number, we used the online calculation developed by [41]. We examined the change in Ln P(D) using the deltaK approach [42]. Because the STRU CTU RE software showed results of each ten replications in the case of K = n, we used CLUMPP to average these results [43]. All of the data were visualized through DISTRUCT v.1.1 [44].\n\nTo estimate the admixture between geographic populations, we used a Bayesian assignment method as implemented in Geneclass2 [45]. This analysis identifies putative first-generation migrants among populations. To calculate individual probabilities of assignment to each population, we used the Monte-Carlo resampling method [46] with 1000 simulated individuals at probability thresholds of α = 0.05. Isolation by distance (IBD) analysis was performed using Mantel tests (1000 permutations) in GenAlex to find the correlation between genetic and geographic distances.\n\n\nSupplementary information\n\nSupplementary information accompanies this paper at https ://doi. org/10.1186/s1286 2-020-01722 -4.\n\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1.

Expanded Conceptual Overview of MINE Procedure. The general procedure for the core MINE algorithm is presented with an example input network, vwp = 0.4 and msp = 0.9. The clustering procedure begins with the highest weighted node, where node weights are assigned as v w = k max * d ( v w = vertex weight, k max = largest edge count Fig. 1 Conceptual Overview of MINE Procedure within node's local neighborhood, d = density ). Nodes are numbered in order visited. Current clusters (blue) are compared to candidate clusters (orange). A node is added to a growing cluster if it passes either of the following criteria: 1) its v w is within the specified range, or 2) the new cluster modularity (m) is within the specified range. The values of v w and m for current and candidate clusters are indicated below each illustrated step; a check mark (or \"x\") is placed next to each value if addition of the new node passes (or fails) the corresponding test. After all possible candidate nodes are visited, the preliminary cluster is processed to remove singly-connected nodes and merged with existing clusters if amount of overlap meets the user-defined threshold.

Such overlap regions are an important source of information in genome annotation. Results: In this paper we introduce a series of algorithms that improve over the approach of Mancheron et al., both in terms of computational complexity and in practical runtime. We also extend the problem definition such that overlaps to different reference genomes can be rated differently and regions overlapping only a subset of the reference genomes are detected.\n\nBackground\n\nComparative approaches are an important source of information when it comes to the analysis of newly sequenced genomes. On the level of genes, the use of reciprocal BLAST hits is the most widely accepted approach suitable for tasks like gene annotation and the inference of homologies. However, it is a notoriously slow process, especially when it comes to all-against-all comparisons of several genomes, as commonly used in multiple genome comparisons. The alignment of whole genomes is known to be a computationally hard problem [1]. Heuristic approaches such as Shuffle-LAGAN [2] or MAUVE [3] involve a combination of chaining local alignments and inferring the history of large-scale genome rearrangement processes, which is an NP-hard problem of its own [1].\n\nRecently, Mancheron et al. [4] pointed out that for many goals in multiple genome comparison, such as gene annotation, whole genome-based approaches as well as allagainst-all BLAST comparisons are too involved. Instead they suggest to identify regions of strong overlaps in a set of pairwise local alignments between one target genome and any number of reference genomes. A strong overlap is a region that maps to at least one segment in every reference genome. If it is not contained in a bigger region that fulfills the same property, it is called a maximum common interval (MCI). In the same paper, Mancheron et al. present an algorithm to compute all MCIs for k genomes and a total number of n mappings in O(n log k) time and O(n) space. Note that the term \"common interval\" has been used previously in a different context, in order to describe a set of genes that occur as a consecutive block in two or more genomes [5,6]. To avoid confusion of the two concepts, we use the term maximum overlapping interval (MOI) in this paper when referring to the concept of maximum common interval by Mancheron et al.\n\nIn this paper, we re-visit the above problem and introduce three new algorithms that improve the asymptotic time complexity as well as the practical performance over the approach of Mancheron et al. [4]. At first we present an algorithm that requires O(n) time and space. Then we show two variations of this basic algorithm: While the first modification reduces memory consumption but keeps the O(n) running time, the second one gives up on linear worst case runtime, but seems to have linear average runtime and is very fast in practice. We also introduce a generalization of the MOI problem, which includes the case where an MOI may map to only q out of k reference genomes. We show how the first two of our algorithms can be adapted to this variant.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nPreliminaries\n\nFor the basic definitions of maximum overlapping intervals we follow closely the notation of Mancheron et al. [4]. Given a finite sequence S, let |S| denote its length. An interval I of a sequence S is a pair I = [s(I), e(I)] of start and end positions within S, i.e. 1 ≤ s(I) ≤ e(I) ≤ |S|. The length of I is defined as e(I)s(I) + 1. The subset relation is defined as usual for intervals, i.e. I 1 ⊆ I 2 if and only if s(I 2 ) ≤ s(I 1 ) and e(I 1 ) ≤ e(I 2 ).\n\nIn the following a target genome is given as a sequence T together with k reference genomes G 1 , . . ., G k . For each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ k, let C j = (I j 1 , I j 2 , ..., I j n j ) be the collection of base intervals representing mappings of G j to T.\n\nAn interval J is an overlapping interval of a set of col-\nlections C = {C 1 , . . ., C k } if and only if there exists an interval I j i in every C j with J ⊆ I j i . An overlapping interval J = [p, q] with p ≤ q is maximum if neither [p -1, q] nor [p, q + 1] are overlapping intervals.\nThe computational problem we study in this paper is the following: given a set of collections of base intervals, find all its maximum overlapping intervals (MOIs).\n\n\nUpper bound for the number of MOIs\n\nBefore presenting our algorithms, we derive a tight upper bound for the number of MOIs in a set of k collections with a total number of n base intervals.\n\nAs already shown in supplementary file 1 of [4], asymptotically there can only be O(n) MOIs: every MOI starts at the beginning of a base interval and no MOI can be included in another MOI, which means that no two MOIs can have the same starting point, so clearly there can not be more than n MOIs. In fact, the bound can be given more precisely:\n\nLemma 1. For k collections with a total number of n base intervals, there can be at most n -k + 1 maximum overlapping intervals. This is a tight bound.\n\nProof. Assume the MOIs to be ordered by their beginning from left to right. Clearly, the leftmost MOI must contain at least k base intervals. Moreover, moving to the right, the next MOI requires at least one new interval, otherwise it would be identical to the previous one. This argument can be repeated for all remaining MOIs. Since after the first MOI there are only nk intervals left, the total number of MOIs can not be larger than 1 + nk.\n\nTo show that the bound is tight, we construct an example where the number of MOIs is actually nk + 1. We set the length of all base intervals to k. The first base interval of the jth collection starts at index j, and the base intervals within each collection follow one after the other such that the ith interval of the jth collection starts at index j + k(i -1). By doing this, the intersection of the first k base intervals defines the first MOI. After that we can replace the left-most starting interval by the next one from its collection. The intersection of the new interval set gives us the next MOI. This can be repeated nk times until all intervals have been processed. Figure 1 illustrates this construction. □\n\n\nAlgorithms for finding maximum overlapping intervals\n\nIn this section we present three new algorithms to find maximum overlapping intervals. Without loss of generality we assume that the set of base intervals is compact, meaning that at least one interval starts or ends at every position in T and thus l := |T | ∈ O(n). We also assume that the list of base intervals is already sorted by increasing start positions. This can be done in linear time using the radix sort algorithm.\n\n\nAlgorithm LinearMOI\n\nThe outline of our first algorithm, LinearMOI, is as follows: while going through the sorted list of base intervals, we track for each of the k collections the largest end point of any of its intervals processed so far. Once we have processed all intervals with the same start position, we test whether the smallest of the current end points, denoted as min, is smaller than the recent start position. If so, there is at least one collection that does not cover the start position, and there is no MOI. If min is greater than the recent start position, then the segment in between is covered by all collections, and is therefore part of an MOI. We only need to test if we have already used min as end point for an MOI starting further to the left. Otherwise the interval ranging from the recent start position to min is an MOI.\n\nObviously, min can change with each new base interval. To update it efficiently, we use a counter array c, indexed from 0 to l, where l is the length of the target genome. In this array we store at each position the number of collections that have their current end point at this position. Clearly, min equals the index of the smallest non-zero entry. The following observation helps us to track this position.\n\nObservation 1. Values in c at indices smaller than the current leftmost non-zero entry do not change when a new base interval is considered.\n\nUsing Observation 1 we can find the current leftmost non-zero entry in c simply by starting from the former leftmost non-zero entry and going to the right until we encounter the first non-zero value. Although we may need several steps for one update of min, the total number of steps can not be larger than l, as min is never decreased. As all other operations for processing a base interval take constant time, and c and endPoint have at most n entries, we get a total runtime of O(l). By our assumption of compactness we thus have a runtime linear in the number of base intervals O(n).\n\nPseudocode of the algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1 (LinearMOI). An example with k = 3 collections and n = 7 base intervals is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\nAlgorithm CircularMOI\n\nThe space needed to store the counter array c of algorithm LinearMOI may become problematic when large genomes are processed. Assuming the human genome as our target, an additional 4GB of memory would be required. However, we find that only a small part of c is informative in each step of the algorithm:\n\nObservation 2. We only need to know if there is any non-zero entry in c left of the recent start position and not where or what this value is.\n\nObservation 3. All positions in c that are further to the right of the recent start position than the length of the longest base interval have value 0.\n\nBased on these observations we can replace array c by a circular memory structure that is just as long as the longest base interval as well as a single counter in which we store the sum of all values that would be on the left of our current position in the counter array.\n\nTo employ the new data structure, several modifications need to be made in algorithm LinearMOI. Obviously we need to use the modulo operation whenever accessing c. We also have to make sure that we do not update c at indices smaller than the recent start position as these positions are no longer represented in the array. For that purpose, we introduce a new variable open to count the number of collections that cover the recent start position.\n\nTo keep open updated, we change the role of variable min: when processing a new interval, we increase min until the recent start position is reached. Any non-zero value encountered in this process is subtracted from open and then set back to 0, so that the respective array positions can be re-used. We also need to update open whenever a collection gets a new endpoint and is not already counted in open.\n\nFinally, we know that we can only have an MOI if open equals k. Therefore we add a test for this condition in line 11. Note that if this condition holds, we use min in its original role to find the endpoint of a potential MOI. The final test before reporting an MOI reduces to testing whether prevEnd is smaller than min. The complete pseudocode of this algorithm is shown in Algorithm 2 (CircularMOI).\n\nIn practice this approach is quite slow because of the extensive use of the modulo operation. However when extending the length of c to the next power of two, the modulo operation can be replaced by a very fast bitwise AND operation, and one gets about the same performance as in the first algorithm. This variant of algorithm CircularMOI was used in the benchmark tests described in the Results section.\n\n\nAlgorithm TestMOI\n\nHaving concentrated on asymptotic runtime so far, we now focus on practical performance. Even though the previous algorithms perform very well in our benchmark experiments, as we will demonstrate in the Results section they use linear extra memory which might limit their usability for larger datasets.\n\nWe present a third algorithm, TestMOI, that works without a counter array. To find min, it just takes the minimum stored in endPoint. Finding this smallest value takes O(k) time and might be needed for every interval, so we get a total runtime of O(kn). Using the following observation as a runtime heuristic, we get back to near-linear performance.\n\nObservation 4. The minimum value of a set of numbers can only increase if a value equal to the smallest value in the set is removed or increased.\n\nTherefore a test for a new minimum needs to be performed only when the smallest of the current endpoints changes. This gives rise to the procedure shown in Algorithm 3 (TestMOI). Assuming the endpoints of the intervals are randomly distributed, the chance of two or more values in end-Point to be identical is very small and the chance that an interval is in the same collection as the smallest current value is 1/k. According to this the expected runtime would be O(kn · 1/k) = O(n). However, this model is possibly oversimplified as there surely is a correlation between the start and the endpoint of an interval, as the base intervals are not the result of a random process but come from local alignments between the target and the reference genomes. Nevertheless the benchmark experiments in the Results section show that in practice the behavior is indeed linear.\n\n\nWeighted maximum overlapping intervals\n\nWe now introduce the concept of weighted maximum overlapping intervals. One constraint for MOIs was that there had to be at least one interval in every collection that covers the MOI. For weighted MOIs we replace this constraint by the following: we assign a positive integer weight to every collection, and require the sum of the weights of all collections covering a weighted MOI to be at least as high as a predefined threshold w. We refer to maximal w-overlapping intervals as weighted MOIs. Note that this concept subsumes the natural extension of MOIs by a quorum parameter q, where an interval is considered an MOI whenever it is covered by base intervals from at least q ≤ k collections. We only need to assign weight 1 to every collection and set the threshold to w = q. By choosing appropriate weights, weighted MOIs allow us to solve more general problems like finding all MOIs that must have an interval in C 1 and one interval either in C 2 or in C 3 . An example of weighted MOIs for different thresholds is given in Figure 3. Our first two algorithms LinearMOI and Circu-larMOI can be adapted straightforwardly to weighted overlapping intervals as shown in the following.\n\n\nAlgorithm LinearWeightedMOI\n\nThis algorithm follows the same ideas as Algorithm 1 (LinearMOI) but we have to make several small adjustments. First we need to change the counter array such that it stores the weights of the collections. The second modification is a bit more complicated. In the unweighted case all values in c left of min are 0, which is not true in the weighted case. To deal with this, we use a similar technique as we already used in Algorithm 2 (CircularMOI). But instead of counting how many collections cover the recent start position, we count the sum of their weights in a variable named openWeight.\n\nIn the beginning, openWeight is set to zero. When updating min or c, we have to make sure that open-Weight gets updated appropriately, which we do in lines 10-12 and 17 in Algorithm 4 (LinearWeightedMOI). We increase min (line 18), as long as openWeight exceeds minWeight. If min was increased since the last weighted MOI was reported and is not smaller than the recent start position, we have found a new weighted MOI.\n\n\nAlgorithm CircularWeightedMOI\n\nIn order to adapt Algorithm 4 (LinearWeightedMOI) to using the circular memory structure, we basically follow the same strategy as we did in the unweighted case. However there is no need to introduce an additional variable as was done for Algorithm 2. This is because we already use variable openWeight which takes over the function of open in Algorithm 2. Apart from this, there is only one non-trivial change in comparison to the unweighted case: a second condition in the if statement in line 12 to ensure that the endpoint of the current base interval is not smaller than the current min. This is because in the weighted case the current base interval can end to the left of the current location of min, and we have to make sure not to update c at indices smaller than min. The details are left to the reader.\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nTo analyze the practical run times of our algorithms, we implemented them in C++ and compared them to the original implementation of the approach by Mancheron et al. [4] which is part of the QOD-1.0.0 software package and available under the CeCILL software license. All benchmarks were performed using an Intel(R) Core (TM)2 Duo CPU T8100 @ 2.10GHz processor with 4GB RAM running Linux 3.3.4. We used the gcc version 4.7 with compiler flags -Ofast and -march = nativeset. If no other values are given, the length of the target genome is 10 Mb and the length of the base intervals is normally distributed around a mean of μ = 2 Kb with a standard deviation of σ = 0.5μ. A total of 5 million intervals are distributed randomly into 200 collections. In order to compare the weighted and unweighted algorithms we set all weights to 1 and the threshold minWeight to k. Please note that the time for sorting the input is not included in any of the reported timings. In any case, sorting the input will virtually take the same time for all algorithms, even though QOD sorts every collection separately, while we sort all base intervals in a single list.\n\nWe ran several tests in order to evaluate the performance of the algorithms for various parameter settings. The results are shown in Figure 4. In all tests our algorithms outperformed the algorithm used by QOD, and TestMOI is the fastest of all.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we studied an algorithmic problem that was recently introduced by Mancheron et al. [4] in the context of multiple genome comparison. The goal is to find regions of strong overlaps in a set of pairwise local similarities between several reference genomes and one target genome.\n\nWe have presented efficient algorithms to solve this problem, two of which have asymptotically optimal, linear runtime. The third one excelled in terms of practical performance. All three algorithms were shown to outperform the approach introduced by Mancheron et al. [4]. We have also generalized the problem such that segments in overlap regions can be scored differently based on the reference genome they originate from. We have shown how this problem can still be solved in linear time.\n\nFor further work it may be interesting to assign individual weights to the base intervals. However we would then have to consider also intervals that are nested into other intervals of lower weight and therefore lose the     strict-linear ordering for processing the intervals. Hence, we can not expect that the algorithms we presented here will be easily adaptable to this problem and still run in linear time.\n\nFigure 1\n1Interval collections with a maximized number of MOIs.

The bars indicate the location of the n = 12 base intervals in T, their colors define the distribution into k = 3 collections (dark, light, medium gray). MOIs are drawn as black lines at the bottom. Their number equals the upper bound n -k + 1 = 10.\n\nFigure 2\n2Example of algorithm LinearMOI. Example of algorithm LinearMOI with C )} (medium gray).

Output is(3,4) in step (d) and (7, 9) in step (h).\n\n\nThe formal definitions are as follows: Given a positive integer weight w, an interval J is a woverlapping interval of a set of collections C = {C 1 , . . ., C k } if and only if the sum of weights of all collections C j that contain an interval I j i with J ⊆ I j i is at least w. A w-overlapping interval J = [p, q] with p ≤ q is maximum if neither [p -1, q] nor [p, q + 1] are w-overlapping intervals.\n\nFigure 3\n3Example of weighted MOIs.

The dotted line shows the number of non-redundant base intervals (scaled by secondary y-axis times 10 5 ); the dashed line shows the number of MOIs (scaled by secondary y-axis times 10 3 ).\n\nTable 1\n1Algorithm 1 (LinearMOI)Input: sorted list of all intervals interval[1..n]; number of collections kVariables: largest end point seen so far in each collection \nendPoint[1..k]; c[0..l] \n\n1: endPoint[1..k] ← 0 \n2: prevEnd ← 0 \n\n3: min ← 0 \n\n4: c[0] ← k; c[1..l ] ← 0 \n\n5: for all (I \n\nj \n\ni = [start, end]) ∈ interval[1..n] do \n\n6: \nif end > endPoint[ j ] then \n\n7: \nc[endPoint[ j]] ← c[endPoint[j]] -1 \n\n8: \nc[end] ← c[end] + 1 \n\n9: \nendPoint[ j] ← end \n10: end if \n\n11: if all intervals with recent start position processed then \n\n12: \nwhile c[min] = 0 do \n\n13: \nmin ← min + 1 \n\n14: \nend while \n\n15: \nif prevEnd < min and min ≥ start then \n\n16: \noutput MOI(start, min) \n\n17: \nprevEnd ← min \n18: \nend if \n\n19: end if \n\n20: end for \n\n\nTable 2\n2Algorithm 2 (CircularMOI) Input: sorted list of intervals interval[1..n]; number of collections k; length of the longest interval ℓ Variables: largest end point seen so far in each collection endPoint[1..k]; c[0..l] 1: endPoint[1..k] ← 0 2: prevEnd ← 0 3: min ← 0 4: c[0..ℓ] ← 0 5: open ← 0 6: for all (I j i = [start, end]) ∈ interval[1..n] do end mod ℓ] ← c[end mod ℓ] + 1 19: endPoint[j] ← end 20: end if 21: if all intervals with recent start position processed and open = k then7: \nwhile min < start do \n\n8: \nopen ← open -c[min mod ℓ] \n\n9: \nc[min mod ℓ] ← 0 \n10: \nmin ← min + 1 \n\n11: end while \n\n12: if end > endPoint[ j] then \n\n13: \nif endPoint[ j ] ≥ min then \n\n14: \nc[endPoint[j] mod ℓ] ← c[endPoint[j] mod ℓ] -1 \n\n15: \nelse \n\n16: \nopen ← open + 1 \n\n17: \nend if \n18: \nc[22: \nwhile c[min mod ℓ] = 0 do \n\n23: \nmin ← min + 1 \n\n24: \nend while \n\n25: \nif prevEnd < min then \n\n26: \noutput MOI(start, min) \n27: \nprevEnd ← min \n\n28: \nend if \n\n29: end if \n\n30: end for \n\n\n\nTable 3\n3Algorithm 3 (TestMOI) Input: sorted list of all intervals interval[1..n]; number of collections k Variables: largest end point seen so far in each collection endPoint[1..k] 12: if newEndPoint and all intervals with recent start position processed then 13: min ← min i = 1..k {endPoint[i]} 14: newEndPoint ← false 15: if prevEnd < min and min ≥ start then1: endPoint[1..k] ← 0 \n2: prevEnd ← 0 \n\n3: min ← 0 \n\n4: newEndPoint ← false \n\n5: for (I \n\nj \n\ni = [start, end]) ∈ interval[1..n] do \n\n6: \nif end >endPoint[ j] then \n\n7: \nif endPoint[ j] = min then \n\n8: \nnewEndPoint ← true \n\n9: \nend if \n10: \nendPoint[ j] ← end \n\n11: end if \n\n16: \noutput MOI(start, min) \n\n17: \nprevEnd = min \n\n18: \nend if \n19: end if \n\n20: end for \n\n\nTable 4\n4Algorithm 4 (LinearWeightedMOI) Input: sorted list of intervals interval[1..n]; number of collections k; weight of the collections weight[1..k]; length l of the target genome; minimum weight a weighted MOI must have minWeight Variables: largest end point seen so far in each collection endPoint[1..k]; c[0..l] 1: endPoint[1..k] ← 0 2: prevEnd ← 0 3: min ← 0 4: openWeight ← 0 5: c[0..l] ← 0 6: for all (Ij i = [start, end]) ∈ interval[1..n] do 7: if end > endPoint[ j ] then 8: c[endPoint[ j]] ← c[endPoint[ j ]] -weight[ j ] 9: c[end] ← c[end] + weight[ j] 10: if endPoint[ j ] < min and end ≥ min then 11: openWeight ← openWeight + weight[ j] 15: if all intervals with recent start position processed then 16: while openWeight -c[min] ≥ minWeight do if prevEnd < min and min ≥ start then12: \nend if \n\n13: \nendPoint[ j] = end \n\n14: end if \n\n17: \nopenWeight ← openWeight -c[min] \n\n18: \nmin ← min + 1 \n19: \nend while \n20: \n21: \noutput MOI(start, min) \n\n22: \nprevEnd ← min \n\n23: \nend if \n\n24: end if \n\n25: end for \n\nAcknowledgementsPart of this work was funded by a postdoctoral fellowship of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity and relationship within and between the four main Sudanese breeds of Nubian, Desert, Taggar and Nilotic goats. Using the 50 K SNP chip, 24 animals of each breed were genotyped. Results: More than 96% of high quality SNPs were polymorphic with an average minor allele frequency of 0.3. In all breeds, no significant difference between observed (0.4) and expected (0.4) heterozygosity was found and the inbreeding coefficients (F IS ) did not differ from zero. F st coefficients for the genetic distance between breeds also did not significantly deviate from zero. In addition, the analysis of molecular variance revealed that 93% of the total variance in the examined population can be explained by differences among individuals, while only 7% result from differences between the breeds. These findings provide evidence for high genetic diversity and little inbreeding within breeds on one hand, and low diversity between breeds on the other hand. Further examinations using Nei's genetic distance and STRUCTURE analysis clustered Taggar goats distinct from the other breeds. In a principal component (PC) analysis, PC1 could separate Taggar, Nilotic and a mix of Nubian and Desert goats into three groups. The SNPs that contributed strongly to PC1 showed high F st values in Taggar goat versus the other goat breeds. PCA allowed us to identify target genomic regions which contain genes known to influence growth, development, bone formation and the immune system. Conclusions: The information on the genetic variability and diversity in this study confirmed that Taggar goat is genetically different from the other goat breeds in Sudan. The SNPs identified by the first principal components show high F st values in Taggar goat and allowed to identify candidate genes which can be used in the development of breed selection programs to improve local breeds and find genetic factors contributing to the adaptation to harsh environments.\n\nBackground\n\nCompared to other African countries, goats in Sudan constitute a large part of the livestock population. With an estimated number of 31 million goats (out of 365 million in whole Africa) that produced about 1.532 million tons of milk in 2013, Sudan was the largest producer of goat milk in Africa and the third largest producer in the world [1]. Goats in Sudan have an important contribution to food security by producing milk and meat. Beyond that, manure and skins provide a source of income for farmers. Thus, goats constitute an important source of livelihood, social security and rural economy. Therefore, the improvement of the productivity of local breeds contributes to rural development. Even under the harsh environments, selection of favorable genome variants could sustainably improve productivity. Systematic genetic diversity studies of indigenous adapted breeds would be necessary to understand the acquired unique features of these breeds.\n\nIn Sudan, different indigenous goat populations are distributed across all agro-ecological zones from the arid region in the North to the fertile Savannah in the South. The adaptation to the harsh climate and the limited feed resources has led to natural selection of goats for minimal maintenance and low water requirements [2]. They developed a high water economy utilizing their body fluid more effectively which ensures the maintenance of an appropriate dry matter intake during periods of water scarcity and thereby, nonetheless, an adequate level of productivity [3].\n\nSudanese goats are classified into Nubian, Desert, Nilotic and Taggar goats [4]. The main classifications of these goats can be shortly summarized as follows: Nubian, a normal size dairy goat commonly found in the semi-arid areas in Sudan. Desert is a dual purpose goat kept by the nomadic tribes of Sudan, and is commonly found in the desert areas of Sudan. The Nilotic goat is mostly used for meat production, after Sudan was split into North and South, it is mostly found in the border area between North and South Sudan. Taggar goats are a species of dwarf goats commonly found in mountainous areas all over Sudan.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of the four above mentioned important indigenous Sudanese goat breeds living in an arid climate and suffering harsh feeding conditions. For the genetic analyses, we used the 50 K goat SNP chip (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The chip provides markers across the whole genome, allowing for precise identification of the whole genome diversity within and among the different populations. Furthermore, the whole genome data made it feasible to identify genomic regions that differ between the breeds and contain genes likely linked to the typical traits of the Sudanese goat breeds.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nAnimals and sampling\n\nBlood samples were collected for genotyping from each of the four goat breeds, Nubian (NU), Desert (D), Taggar (T), and Nilotic (NI), 24 representative female animals were sampled from different regions of Sudan (Additional file 1: Table S1).\n\nNubian goats were collected at six locations in four different states along the river Nile, the Dongola area (Northern State), Abu Hamad, Aldamir, Shendi (River Nile State), Khartoum (Khartoum State) and Aljazirah (Aljazirah State). In total Nubian samples were obtained from 10 villages, three districts, one university farm, and three research stations.\n\nDesert goat samples were collected from Bara and Abu Zabad area in the North Kordofan state (eight villages, one university farm).\n\nTaggar goat samples were obtained from the Nuba Mountains and Dalang area in the South Kordofan state (five villages, one research station).\n\nNilotic goat samples were collected in the Kosti and Rabak areas in the White Nile state (eight villages).\n\nLivestock experts, herdsmen and owners of the animals were consulted to ensure representative sampling of unrelated animals.\n\nThe characterization of the different Sudanese goat breeds are the following:\n\n\nNubian goat\n\nNubian is a highly productive dairy goat compared to other Sudanese goat breeds. Nubian goats are widely distributed in arid and extreme arid areas [4]. Besides Sudan, Nubian goats are found widespread in North Eastern Africa and the Mediterranean coastal belt. They have likely their origin in Sudan [5]. These goats are commonly black, but pure brown and multi-colorations of black and white also exist [6,7].\n\n\nDesert goat\n\nSudanese Desert goats are dual purpose goats. They are mainly found in semi-arid areas of the West of Sudan. They also move to extreme arid areas during nomadic migration. The efficient transformation of low quality feed into body mass makes the Desert goat valuable for the production of meat [8]. Desert goats are phenotypically similar to West African long-legged goats, and are possibly related to the Nubian goats [4]. Coat color is variable and mixed colors exist [9,10].\n\n\nTaggar goat\n\nTaggar is a meat-type goat that has adapted to survive under harsh environmental conditions [11][12][13]. It is kept in many parts of Sudan with the highest density in the Nuba Mountain area close to the border to South Sudan.\n\nTaggar is a dwarf goat with disproportionally short legs, plump body and short head. The short stature is thought to result from achondroplastic dwarfism with lack of ossification at the cartilage joints [13,14]. It is assumed that natural selection for the recessive dwarfism gene was favorable in response to the humid and hot climate conditions [4]. The most common coat colors for Taggar goats are dark or grey brown [7,12].\n\n\nNilotic goat\n\nNilotic goat is another meat-type goat that produces high muscle mass under good feeding conditions [15]. Nilotic goats have a high reproductive potential since they reach sexual maturity at an early age. Nilotic goats live in the border region between Sudan and South Sudan. They distinguish from other breeds through their resistance against Trypanosomiasis [16]. These goats are small in size; the body is compact, but has normal proportions [6,7,17,18]. Though, different from Taggar goats, achondroplasia does not occur in this breed. Almost all colors occur, but the predominant color is a mixture of black and white.\n\n\nGenotyping\n\nBlood samples were collected from the jugular vein using vacutainer tubes containing EDTA as anticoagulant. Blood was stored at −20°C until DNA was extracted using the Puregen core kit A (Qiagen Sciences, Maryland, USA). All animals were genotyped with the Goat SNP52 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA), developed by the International Goat Genome Consortium (IGGC) [19]. The raw signal intensities of the 53,347 SNPs on the chip were imaged using the Illumi-naScan Reader and converted into genotype calls with GenomeStudio software suite (version 2011.1) by using the SNP genomic locations and cluster file made available by IGGC (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/organisms/goat_ 9925/viewBatch/snpBatch_IGGC_1057128.gz). Locations of the SNP probes were remapped using BLASTN towards the CHIR 1.0, CHIR 2.0 and LWT01 genome version of Capra hircus. This was done to provide future researchers with an easy way to compare our results with their own work, since other researchers can find the corresponding locations on the genome version of their choice. Locations reported in this paper are based on the CHIR1.0 genome build. Locations of protein coding genes on the CHIR1.0 genome were obtained from The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/]; the version used is available as supplemental file (Additional file 2: locations of Protein coding genes).\n\n\nSNP quality control\n\nThe R language for statistical computing v3.2.3 was used for quality control of the called SNP data [20]. From the entire set of 53,347 SNPs, only those with an Illumina GenTrain score ≥ 0.6 were kept (1441 SNPs failed). Furthermore, all SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 5% (2273 SNPs) as well as SNPs which showed more than 5% missing data (150 SNPs) were excluded from further analysis. The deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was calculated and we found only 42 SNPs not in HWE. Since HWE deviations only concerns a very limited amount of SNPs <0.1% of the total, we decided to not remove these SNPs from further analysis. SNP probe sequences were mapped against the CHIR1.0 genome assembly using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [21,22]. Probe sequences that were not mapping in the CHIR1.0 genome (41 SNPs) or probes which showed multiple hits (937 SNPs) against the reference genome were dropped from further analysis. 48,505 SNPs passed the quality control. Based on quality control of the data, one sample (Nubian goat) was excluded from further analysis.\n\n\nStatistical analyses Genetic diversity assessment\n\nIn order to assess the genetic diversity, the minor allele frequency, distribution and proportion of polymorphic SNPs were computed using the R language for statistical computing v3.2.3 [20]. To measure the genetic variation within a population, mean observed heterozygosity (H o ) and expected heterozygosity (H E ) for each breed of goats and the total population were analyzed using the diveRsity R package v.1.9.89 [23]. The average population inbreeding coefficient (F IS ) using Sewall Wright's method [24] and the pairwise genetic differentiation between populations (F st ) were also calculated using the diveRsity package. To detect the level of genetic variation among samples within populations and among populations at different hierarchical levels, the Analysis of MOlecular VAriance (AMOVA) [25] was performed using StAMPP R package [26]. StAMPP calculates an AMOVA based on the Nei's genetic distance matrix using the amova() function from the package PEGAS for exploring within and between population variation. StAMPP uses the formula: distance = populations, to calculate a hierarchical AMOVA as described in Excoffier et al. [25] to explore population differentiation and within/between population variation.\n\n\nHierarchical clustering\n\nTo measure the genetic distance between the four goat populations, hierarchical clustering of SNP data was performed. Pairwise Nei's genetic distances [27] between all individuals were calculated from the SNP data by using the StAMPP R package [26]. Additionally, we used Reynolds [28] and Manhattan [29] distances between individuals (Additional file 3: Figure S1). Distances were clustered using the hclust function in R. After clustering of genetic distances between individuals, the ape package [30] was used to convert the resulting dendrogram into a phylogentic tree. For visualization of the phylogenetic tree a standard ape plotting functions was used.\n\n\nSTRUCTURE analysis\n\nPopulation structure was determined by using a modelbased clustering for assigning individuals from multi locus genotypes to a population using the STRUC-TURE 2.3.3 software suite [31][32][33]. STRUCTURE uses a maximum likelihood method to infer the genetic ancestry of each individual from a mixture of K pre-defined ancestral groups. STRUCTURE analysis was carried out using an admixture model and correlated allele frequencies. Under the hypothesis of two to five subpopulations K was set from 2 to 5 and the length of the burn-in period was set to 100,000 iterations, followed by 100,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. The whole analysis was then repeated five times in STRUCTURE to prevent the model from producing local optimal results. In our analysis, all five runs gave similar results. Results from STRUCTURE were loaded back into the R environment to visualize resulting groups. The most likely hierarchical level of genetic structure was determined by log probability of the data (Ln Pr (X|K) [33] and observed variance of this probability.\n\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA)\n\nAs a different approach to characterize divergence, the genetic relationship between animals was analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) using the 'prcomp' function in the R language. PCA is a statistical method for exploring and interpretation of big data by reducing the dimension of the data to the few principal components which capture the majority of the genetic variation observed in the genotypes. We visualized the contribution of individuals to the first 10 principal components; from our data we observe that a combination of PC1 and PC2 shows a good separation between different goat breeds. As such we investigate which SNPs allow PCA to separate between the four populations of Sudanese goats; we investigated which SNPs contribute highly to PC1.\n\nTo select high impact SNPs we calculated the variable correlations with PC1 by multiplying the loading factors with the component standard deviations. Quality of representation for all variables on the factor map (cos 2 ) was calculated as the squared variable correlation. Afterwards, we summed up all the cos 2 values for PC1 and expressed each SNP contribution as percentage of total variation. We then looked for SNPs which have more than 10 times the expected contribution to PC1 (contribution ≥0.02%, expected 0.0021%). These SNPs will capture most of the differentiation among breeds separated by PC1. We extracted genes within a region of 500 kb cis-window around these high contributing SNPs according to SNP Annotation and Proxy Search (SNAP) [34].\n\n\nResults\n\nThe main result from this study is that Taggar goats show significant genetic differences from the other three goat breeds. In all our analysis e.g. F st , STUCTURE, clustering and PCA we observe that Taggar goats show significant genetic differences compared to the other breeds.\n\n\nGenetic diversity within breeds\n\nThe percentage of polymorphic SNPs within each breed among all 48,505 SNPs that passed the quality control was very high, ranging from 96.9% (Taggar goat) to 98.2% (Desert goat) ( Table 1). After removing SNPs with MAF below 0.05, the average minor allele frequency, was about the same for Nubian (0.31 ± 0.12), Desert (0.31 ± 0.12), Nilotic (0.31 ± 0.13), and Taggar (0.30 ± 0.13) goats. The distribution of minor allele frequencies across the Sudanese goat populations are represented in Fig. 1a. Rare variant MAFs were observed in about 3.1%, 2.2%, 2% and 1.8% in Taggar, Nilotic, Nubian, and Desert goat breeds respectively.\n\nAdditionally, observed and expected heterozygosity values were the same for the examined Nubian, Desert, and Taggar populations (0.39). For Nilotic goats, the expected heterozygosity (0.40) was slightly higher than observed (0.39). The high degree of heterozygosity and the coincidence of expected and observed heterozygosity indicate high genetic diversity and near to zero inbreeding within each breed. This was further confirmed by the inbreeding coefficients (F IS ). The population inbreeding coefficients (F IS ) ranged from −0.0129 in Taggar goats to 0.0094 in Nilotic goats and did not significantly differ from zero (Table 1). These values indicate that there is neither inbreeding nor strong kinship within the studied populations. To further confirm this observation, we calculated the kinship matrix using the 'kinship' function from the EMMA package [35], EMMA calculates kinship based on identity by state (IBS), meaning that two unrelated individuals measured using SNP markers on average show a kinship coefficient of 0.5, when looking at the values calculated we that kinship between most individuals ranges between 0.64 and 0.71. Between two pairs of individuals we find a slightly increased kinship of 0.81. EMMA analysis confirms that no strong kinship exists between individuals (Additional file 4: Figure S2).\n\n\nGenetic diversity between breeds\n\nThe estimates for pairwise genetic differentiation between populations (F st ) were low and varied between 0.0053 (Nubian vs. Desert) and 0.0229 (Nubian vs. Taggar) (  Figure S3.) from the supplemental figure it becomes clear that using F st values we are unable to observe regions which explain inter-breed differences. This motivated us to perform additional PCA analysis to further look for other ways to find regions which show inter-breed differences. AMOVA confirmed the high within population variation  and low differentiation between populations. The largest proportion of the variation (93.04%) was attributable to the variation within individuals (Additional file 6: Table S2). Differences between populations accounted for only 6.96% of the variance, but was highly significant (P < 1.0 * 10 −6 ). Hierarchical clustering using Nei's genetic distances clearly shows two different clusters (Cluster I and II) (Fig. 1b). Within Cluster I, the Taggar population forms a distinct group (Cluster I group b); however, we observed two Desert goat individuals positioned within the Taggar cluster. In addition, four Nilotic goat individuals clustered closely together and formed a distinct subgroup (Cluster I group a) which shows a closer relationship to Taggar goats (Cluster I group b). Cluster II comprises all Nubian goats, except one outlier (marked with a * in Fig. 1b), and the remaining Desert and Nilotic goats. Within cluster II, Nilotic goats clustered in a smaller sub-group (Cluster II group a) with an approximately Nei's genetic distance of 0.31 between individuals belonging to this cluster. None of the Taggar goats was assigned to cluster II. Similar clusters were observed when SNP data was clustered using different distances measurements, such as Manhattan or Reynold distances (Additional file 3: Figure S1).\n\n\nSTRUCTURE analysis\n\nThe genetic structure among all goats was studied using a Bayesian model-based approach that assigns each individual to one or more populations based on the allele frequencies detected at different loci. Following STRUC-TURE analysis the posterior probability (Ln P(D)) of the data indicated the most optimal K value to be 2 (Additional file 7: Table S3).\n\nFor K > 2, there is a higher variance of the log likelihood values, while the mean log likelihood of models K > 2 is worse compared to the K = 2 model. With K = 2, individuals were assigned into two main genetic clusters. When looking at a default clustering threshold of 50%, cluster 2 contained 18 out of 24 Taggar goats, while cluster 1 comprised of Nubian, Desert, Nilotic, and six Taggar goats (Fig. 1c). However, when we put the clustering threshold at 60% contribution compared to the default 50% used by STRUCTURE all Taggar goats, and a single Desert goat is in the second cluster.\n\nResults from the STRUCTURE analysis with K = 2 to 5 is summarized in Additional file 7: Table S3, the graphical STRUCTURE plots of the Sudanese goat breeds from K = 2 to 5 are shown in Additional file 8: Figure S4.\n\n\nPCA analysis\n\nPCA was used to assess how different the four Sudanese goat populations are. Figure 2a shows the individual loadings of the first and second principal component (PC) against each other. We observed that the loading of PC1 resulted in tight clustering by breed. PC1 could separate three out of four different subpopulations, namely Taggar, Nilotic and a mix of Desert and Nubian goats, this is also seen in Fig. 2b (contribution of individuals to each PC) where the Taggar goats are colored green (high contribution), the Nilotic goats are mostly yellow (average contribution), and the other 2 breeds have a low contribution to the first principal component. Although this separation is not perfect, we assume this could be We do not observe another principal component in the first 10 components investigated that cause this clear of a separation between breeds, which is expected since PCs are ordered by their variance explained. PC2 was able to separate some of the Nubian (PC2 ≤ 0) from the Desert goat population (PC2 > 0) this is not clearly observable in Fig. 2b, since the classification here seems to depend on 5 Desert goats in green (high contribution) versus 4 Nubian goats in red (low contribution). The first two principal components explained 2.5% (PC1) and 1.9% (PC2) of the genetic variation observed between all individuals. PC1 and PC2 together seemed to be able to almost classify samples into their respective breed, we do observe overlap of some of the Desert goat samples with Taggar, Nilotic and Nubian goats. PCA using 48,505 SNPs allowed us to detect which SNPs contributed highly to PC1 and thereby to the genetic differentiation between Taggar, Nilotic and Nubian goats. To investigate the SNPs which have a high contribution to PC1, we generated a list of SNPs which had a 10 times higher contribution to PC1 compared to the expected contribution (Additional file 9: Sheet 1). We found that 49 SNPs out of 48,505 contributed highly to the PC1, which are visualized in Fig. 2c.\n\n\nRelationship between F st and contribution to PC1\n\nTo further investigate our results that SNPs contributing highly to PC1 are biologically important in the distinction between Taggar goats versus the other Sudanese breeds. We explored this by investigating if these SNPs show higher than average differentiation. We used the F st values of the SNPs which contributed highly to PC1. Since this would give us an independent line of evidence that these SNPs are important in the differentiation of the Taggar goat versus the other goat breeds, and that our PCA approach allows us to identify these regions. We therefore plot the F st values of the four different breeds against the combination of the three other breeds at the positions of the SNPs contributing to PC1 (as can been seen in Fig. 3). We observe significant higher F st values in the Taggar versus the other goat breeds at these SNPs. All 49 SNPs selected by PCA analysis, show F st values higher than at least mean(F st ) + 2 SDs. This means that these SNPs show signs of differentiation in Taggar goats versus the other breeds. This is not observed for any of the other three goat breeds. Desert goats versus the other breeds showed only 5 SNPs above threshold, Nilotic goats versus the other breeds showed no SNPs above the threshold, and Nubian versus the rest showed 8 SNPs above the threshold, this means that the regions contributing to PC1 are regions of high differentiation in Taggar goats, but are not regions of high differentiation in the other Sudanese breeds.\n\n\nGenes near SNPs contributing to PC1\n\nTo investigate regions which show a high contribution to PC1 and have a high F st values in Taggar versus the other goats, we selected genes from a region of 500 kb around those SNPs. We extracted 208 genes (Additional file 9: Sheet 2). Among these genes we found genes known to be involved in the following physiological traits:\n\nBone formation (sclerostin, epiphycan, bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A precursor, arylsulfatase G, mesenchyme homebox 1, ClpB homolog mitochondrial AAA ATPase chaperonin) Blood (water balance, glucose, and salts) homeostasis (vasopressin, haptoglobin, hepatocyte growth factor activator), sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger (solute carrier family 24 member 5) Heart and muscle (phospholamban, myosin phosphatase, mitochondrial cardiolipin hydrolase) Growth / dwarfism (Stanniocalcin-1, inhibitor of growth protein 5) Eye development (keratocan, lumican, melanopsin, epiphycan, retinal guanylyl cyclase 2, beta-crystallin A3, all-trans-retinol 13,14-reductase) Coat color (sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 5)\n\nUnfortunately, gene-ontology (GO) is not available for goats, so we are unable to perform GO testing on these groups of genes. Their location around the SNPs that contributed highly to PC1 and the high F st values observed in Taggar goats makes these genes together with the other positional candidate genes interesting targets for the analysis of adaptation found between the different Sudanese goat breeds.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study was conducted to contribute to the genetic characterization of the economically most interesting indigenous goat breeds in Sudan. Using the 50 k goat SNP chip, we examined the genetic diversity within and between breeds, the breed differentiation, and the genetics contributing to breed differences.\n\nHigh levels of genetic diversity within the examined goat populations were observed. More than 96% of SNPs that passed the quality check were polymorphic in each breed albeit SNPs on the chip were selected from breeds such as Saanen, Alpine, Creole, Boer, Kacang, and Savanna and did not consider indigenous East African breeds [19]. Since the expected and observed heterozygosity in the examined Sudanese goat breeds were similar (0.39), we did not find heterozygote deficiency. Using the same SNP chip, heterozygosity in Sudanese goat breeds was similar to Bakri goats in Egypt (0.40) [36], Ethiopian goats breeds (0.38) [37] and Angora goats from South Africa (0.37) [38]. Consistent with low heterozygote deficiency and high allelic diversity, inbreeding within Sudanese goat breeds was also close to zero. The inbreeding coefficient estimated for Sudanese Nubian goats (F IS = 0.001) was consistent with previous findings for Nubian goats in Ethiopia (F IS = 0.073) [37]. This outcome indicates the highly diverse genetic reservoir of Sudanese goats.\n\nThe low F st values among Sudanese breeds indicate low genetic differentiation among these populations, which in turn mirrors the population history with a likely common origin and the recent husbandry system in connection with nomadic traditions. AMOVA further supported this finding by providing evidence that most variation was distributed within individuals and to a lesser extent genetic variation (6.96%) was explained by differences among the Sudanese goat populations.\n\nBy applying different genetic distance clustering methods, STRUCTURE and PCA, we observed clear separation of Taggar goats towards the other goat breeds. Taggar, which is a dwarf goat, and was identified as the most genetically distinct group in respect to other goat populations in this study. The output of the STRUCTURE analysis at K = 2 further supported this finding. It clearly distinguished Taggar from the other Sudanese goat breeds. This finding could be explained by the fact that Taggar goats are geographically isolated in the mountain regions of Sudan. Mountain regions could have caused natural selection of small animals which are more nimble and feed efficient, which over the course of many generations could have led to the dwarfism phenotype we observe currently in Taggar goats. This natural selection might have caused genetic signatures in Taggar not observed in the other three breeds. Additionally, since Taggar goats are geographically separated (mountain versus low-lands) this might have played a limiting role in their ability to mate with the other three low-land goat breeds in Sudan, thus explaining why they show a clear separation from the other goat breeds.\n\nIt is observed that Desert goats are most scattered amongst the other two goats (Nilotic and Nubian). This could be due to Desert goat husbandry: (1) forced by changing market conditions, they began to shift from dual purpose to dairy goats by crossing their Desert goats with Nubian goats [39], and (2) Desert goats are owned by nomadic tribes who use communal grazing lands and watering points, where different herds meet and randomly mate which leads to gene flow.\n\nBased on Nei's genetic distance we find a closer relationship between Taggar and a sub-group of Nilotic goats, which could be attributed to the low geographical distance between the two populations in the mountain area of the Southern part of Sudan.\n\nPrincipal component analysis showed that the first two principal components could be used to differentiate between Sudanese goat breeds and to assign individuals to a particular breed. PC1 shows separation of Taggar goats, Nilotic goats, and a mixed of Desert and Nubian goats. PC2 seems to be able to differentiate between Nubian and Desert goats, though some misclassifications still remain. SNPs contributing highly to PC1 allowed us to define regions of the genome at which the Taggar goats are significantly different from the other three breeds. Among the genes in the vicinity of the SNPs contributing to PC1, we identified genes which might be interesting candidates when looking at breed characteristics and adaptation differences between Sudanese breeds studied here. Among them we found genes known to contribute to bone formation, blood homeostasis, heart and muscle development, growth, eye development, and coat color.\n\nWithin the list of the genes there are genes such as sclerostin and bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A precursor known to have an effect on the bone morphology and formation. Studying differences in these genes could elucidate the underlying genetics of the differences between Sudanese goat breeds in regard to bone formation and body measurements characteristics. The Stanniocalcin-1 gene on chromosome 8 is one of the genes, which is interesting for the discrimination among breeds, since Taggar goats are a species of achondroplastic dwarf goats with lack of ossification at the cartilage joints [13,14]. Stanniocalcin-1 acts as a paracrine regulator of growth plate chondrogenesis [40]. This gene is known to cause dwarfism in mice when it is over expressed [41].\n\nSeveral other genes that are important for blood metabolism and homeostasis fell within regions in the PC1. This might reflect the adaptation of the Sudanese goat breeds to different environmental conditions. An example is the Desert goat which can survive in the areas where the lack of water resources is dominant. In a similar way, we detected candidate genes in regions which differ between the goat breeds for heart and muscle characteristics. Since natural variation is present between the breeds differences in these genes could provide targets for genomic breeding to improve meat quality.\n\nThe detection of genomic differences based on the principle component 1 (PC1) which allows for the separation of the Sudanese goat breeds can shed light on the genes underlying the adaptations. Natural variation present between these breeds provide a unique opportunity to improve local breeds through breeding using genomic markers or to breed improved resistance to harsh climates into imported high production breeds. Therefore, further research is required to identify the genomic regions which are associated with different important economical traits in Sudanese goat breeds.\n\nFig. 1\n1Genetic diversity among Sudanese Goats.

We further conclude that the first principal components allow us to differentiate between Sudanese goat breeds. Furthermore F st values of these SNPs show high differentiation for Taggar goats, but no significant differentiation for the other breeds under study. Genes in the proximity of these SNPs contributing highly to the first principal component might be interesting candidates when looking at breed characteristics and adaptation differences in Taggar goats.Additional filesAdditional file 1:Table S1Consent for publication Not applicableCompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Publisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.

The study was part of the development of a new genetic test on the susceptibility to hand eczema for nurses. Eighty student nurses participated in five focus groups (n033), 15 interviews (n015) or questionnaires (n032). For each method, data were collected until saturation. We compared the mean number of items and relevant remarks that could influence the use of the genetic test obtained per method, divided by the number of participants in that method. Thematic content analysis was performed using MAXQDA software. The focus groups revealed 30 unique items compared to 29 in the interviews and 21 in the questionnaires. The interviews produced more items and relevant remarks per participant (1.9 and 8.4 pp) than focus groups (0.9 and 4.8 pp) or questionnaires (0.7 and 2.3 pp). All three involvement methods revealed relevant barriers and facilitators to use a new genetic test. Focus groups and interviews revealed substantially more items than questionnaires. Furthermore, this study suggests a preference for the use of interviews because the number of items per participant was higher than for focus groups and questionnaires. This conclusion may be valid for other genetic tests as well.\n\nBackground\n\nResearch knowledge reaches healthcare practice only partially and through a process that on average takes many years (Balas and Boren 2000;Glasziou and Haynes 2005). It is a complicated process that requires changes in behaviour, practices and policy from different stakeholders (Straus et al. 2009). An important activity or action before applying a new knowledge product in practice is the identification of items that can hinder or facilitate the use of this product (Graham et al. 2006;Straus et al. 2009). Barriers and facilitators are often related to the research product itself, the context and the implementation strategies used (Greenhalgh et al. 2004;Grol and Wensing 2006). Accounting for these barriers and facilitators prior to actual application is supposed to result in knowledge products that are better tailored to the needs of the intended users and to the context (Graham et al. 2006;Straus et al. 2009;Ward et al. 2009).\n\nThe involvement of intended users is recognised to be important for the identification of potential barriers and facilitators (Bartholomew et al. 2006;Graham et al. 2006;Grol and Wensing 2006;International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 1999;Kujala 2003;Steiner and Norman 2008;Straus et al. 2009). The most common methods of involving users are focus groups, interviews and questionnaires (Bryman 2001;Denzin and Lincoln 2000;Kvale 1996). In the social sciences, these three methods are consid-ered to be \"qualitative research methods\". The aim of using these methods is to explore the diversity of attitudes, ideas or beliefs on potential barriers and facilitators to use a new knowledge product (Denzin and Lincoln 2000). In general, individual interviews and focus groups are utilised to collect in-depth data on a small number of people, where focus groups are supposed to have the additional advantage that they can encourage discussion between participants when needed. Questionnaires are used to collect less in-depth data on a larger group of individuals. Remarkably, research comparing the output and efficiency of these methods, e.g. the number of barriers and facilitators taking into account the effort to obtain them, is scarce (Morgan 1996).\n\nInvolving users and analysing their attitudes, ideas or beliefs takes time and effort. If one method, or a combination of methods, has a higher output per participant, it would be a more attractive option in the process of applying new knowledge products in practice. We used the opportunity to compare three common involvement methods in an ongoing scientific study aiming at developing a genetic test for the susceptibility to hand eczema. Involvement of potential users of this genetic test prior to its application in practice was used to anticipate on its (clinical) utility and on ethical, legal and social issues such as described in the ACCE framework or Evaluation of Genomic Application in Practice and Prevention initiative (Sanderson et al. 2005;Teutsch et al. 2009).\n\nHand eczema (HE) is a common skin disease with 1-year period prevalence rates reportedly ranging from 6% to 11% in the general population of northern Europe (Belsito 2005;Diepgen and Coenraads 1999). Some occupations, e.g. hairdressing and nursing, show an increased risk of HE due to the frequent contact with irritants or allergens (Chew and Maibach 2003;Diepgen 2003). Hand eczema also has an endogenous genetic component (Kezic et al. 2009). Recent research findings on exposure to irritants or allergens and on markers of genetic susceptibility can be used to create a genetic test that estimates a personal relative risk for HE: a hand eczema genetic susceptibility test (de Jongh et al. 2008a, b;Molin et al. 2009). If such a test is offered to student nurses, it may contribute to the prevention of HE in this profession. The test results could be used for personal preventive measures, e.g. wearing special gloves, or even for choosing another career within or outside of the profession. It is not unlikely that such a test will be developed in the near future, especially regarding the high prevalence of HE. Currently, the predictive value of certain genetic polymorphisms for the risk of HE is under study.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the output (per participant) of focus groups, interviews and questionnaires in revealing barriers and facilitators from student nurses for using a new genetic test for susceptibility to hand eczema.\n\nFor this purpose, we first established the number of different items that can influence student nurses' decision to use this new genetic test for each involvement method (output). Subsequently, we evaluated the output in relation to the number of participants needed to obtain this output.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nStudy population\n\nThe designated study population consisted of student nurses who were at least 16 years of age and attended one of three nursing schools in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Before recruitment, the school institutional review boards agreed with the study protocol. In total, four different recruitment techniques were used. First, by e-mail, we invited 154 students who studied in the Amsterdam area and participated in an on-going national cohort study (Visser et al., unpublished data). In this national cohort of approximately 700 student nurses, genetic susceptibility towards HE is studied. Secondly, we gave 2-min introductions in classes to invite students to participate. Thirdly, we placed posters on school message boards and school cafeteria tables. Lastly, by means of convenience sampling, we approached student nurses at the schools directly. We made sure that the proportions of participants recruited with these four techniques were comparable in the focus groups, interviews and questionnaires. All recruitment methods included a brief explanation of the study and a reward for participation. When desired, participants were refunded their travel costs.\n\n\nData collection\n\nThe execution and analysis of the three qualitative research methods were based on core literature (Bryman 2001;Denzin and Lincoln 2000;Kitzinger 1995;Kvale 1996). To create a topic list for guiding the involvement methods and the analysis of results, we first performed a literature search on factors (items) that could influence nurses' decisions, beliefs or attitudes towards the use of a genetic test that estimates the personal risk for HE.  [tw]). This search was limited to information published between September first 1999 and September first 2009, to human studies and to papers published in the English language. This search revealed 1,502 possibly relevant studies. MR and MV independently scanned all retrieved citations based on title and abstracts. Subsequently, the full texts of articles of relevant abstracts were retrieved. Ten relevant studies were selected for the purpose of this investigation (Cameron et al. 2009;Cameron and Muller 2009;Condit 2001;Harel et al. 2003;Henneman et al. 2004Henneman et al. , 2006Sanderson et al. 2004;Sussner et al. 2009;Tercyak et al. 2006;Toiviainen et al. 2003). From these studies and from our personal experience, we formulated 22 items that could influence the use of a genetic test. The items were clustered in 10 domains and processed in a topic list (\"Appendix 1\"). The 10 domains were: (1) expected use of genetic test (results); (2) test content; (3) feelings and emotions; (4) involvement with HE; (5) principles/beliefs; (6) expected effects of HE; (7) relative risk of developing HE; (8) accessibility, safety and privacy; (9) practical considerations and (10) social influence and media.\n\nAll three involvement methods comprised two parts and started with an introduction on the purpose of the study, the time schedule and confidentiality. During the first part, following the introduction, a hypothetical \"case\" was presented in which a genetic test for susceptibility to HE was introduced (Fig. 1). This presentation was concluded by two questions: (1) Would you use this test? (yes, no or doubt) and (2) What are your motives for using or not using this test? (open question). In the focus groups and interviews, answers were first noted by the participants and were subsequently discussed. During the second part, we introduced and discussed a topic list with items extracted from the literature. Participants were asked if (yes or no) and how (open question) the different items of this topic list would influence their choice to use this test. The items that had already been discussed during the first part were not reviewed. After this discussion, participants were invited to mention supplemental items.\n\nBefore application, the focus group protocol, interview protocol and questionnaire were all piloted. Additionally, a draft version of the electronic questionnaire was tested on comprehensibility among four workers from the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. By convenience sampling, we recruited one worker from the catering service, one from the transport service and two student nurses.\n\nThe focus groups were held between October and December 2009 and were moderated by MR. MV participated as the case presenter and observer. Both researchers had been trained in qualitative methods. Focus group sessions lasted for about 2 h and were audio-recorded. Five to eight student nurses participated in each group, numbers depending on availability for the scheduled time. Participants received a gift coupon with a value of €20,-. The \"case\" was presented using PowerPoint and ended with the two discussion questions. We stimulated discussion by asking open-ended, non-guiding questions and encouraged all participants to contribute. To facilitate the discussion of the topic list in the second part of the session, we presented each domain (if not mentioned before) on flip-over sheets. We stopped the data collection at the point of data saturation, i.e. when two subsequent focus groups did not reveal any new items that could influence using a genetic test for HE.\n\nSemi-structured interviews were executed between February and April 2010 by MR, MV and MMV. The interviews lasted for about 45 min, were audio-recorded and took place in a quiet room. Participants received a gift coupon with a value of €10,-. The \"case\" and the questions were provided in text and read out loud to the participants (Fig. 1). After reading the case, the interviewer left the room for a short period while the participants noted down their answers. Subsequently, the answers were discussed. To facilitate the discussion of the topic list in the second part of the interview, we presented all clustered literature items to the participants (if not mentioned before) on small cards. The interview data collection process was ended at the point of data saturation, i.e. when three subsequent interviews did not reveal any new items.\n\nThe electronic questionnaire, with combined closed and open-ended questions, was emailed to 51 participants in May 2010. We sent out one email reminder. Respondents were rewarded with a small gift (value €5,-). Participants received an introductory email with a hyperlink to the electronic questionnaire, which included 56 questions and took about 20 min to complete. The questionnaire mainly followed the protocols of the focus groups and interviews, which involved starting with the \"case\" and the two discussion questions on the use of the test and related motives. Subsequently, we introduced the domains one by one on separate pages. For each of the items within these domains, participants were asked if (yes or no) and how (open question) the item would influence their choice to use this test. Before proceeding to the next domain, participants were invited to provide supplemental items. Respondents were not able to go back to a previous page. The questionnaire data collection was ended at the point of data saturation, i.e. when five subsequent questionnaires did not reveal any new items.\n\nAll three methods were concluded by the participants' completion of a short questionnaire on personal and professional characteristics and general knowledge of and experience with genetics and genetic testing (\"Appendix 2\"). Because we believe that the stakeholders' perceived satisfaction with their involvement and contribution during the involvement method can directly influence their involvement output, we added the question: \"How satisfied are you with your contribution during the focus group/interview/survey?\" To prevent bias due to socially desirable answering, this questionnaire was completed anonymously.\n\n\nData analysis and coding\n\nMR and MV performed a thematic content analysis with the data from all involvement methods. The audio-taped data from the first part of the focus groups and interviews was transcribed and analysed using MAXQDA software Fig. 1 Case: a genetic test for susceptibility to hand eczema. The case was used to guide the focus groups, interviews and questionnaires (VERBI Software, Marburg, Germany, 2006) that facilitates with organising and presenting large quantities of qualitative data. Each relevant unit of text remark was coded according to the taxonomy of 10 domains and 22 items as extracted from the literature. Remarks that could not be coded according to our taxonomy were iteratively discussed by MR and MV, and if necessary, new items or domains were created. From this point on, \"literature items\" refer to items spontaneously mentioned during the first part of the involvement methods that corresponded with one of the 22 items extracted from literature. \"New items\" refer to items spontaneously mentioned that were additional to the literature. We also noted whether the items hindered or facilitated the use of a genetic test for hand eczema susceptibility.\n\nThe output per participant of an involvement method was calculated by the total number of items (literature+new) or the total number of relevant remarks (literature + new) obtained per method, divided by the number of participants in that method, i.e. the mean number of items or relevant remarks per participant. The total number of items revealed per method could not be compared statistically as the total number of items is related to the combined group and not to individuals. For interviews and questionnaires, the number of remarks per participant was compared using Wilcoxon's rank-sum test. The number of remarks per participant in the focus groups could not be compared statistically with that of the interviews and questionnaires because the number of remarks was only available per focus group and not per individual.\n\nTo establish (i.e. rule out) possible differences in participant characteristics between the methods, we applied the chi-squared test for dichotomous variables, the Yates and Cochran test for ordinal variables and one-way ANOVA for continuous variables. For this purpose, we used α00.1.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nParticipant characteristics\n\nDetermined by the saturation criteria, 80 student nurses participated in the three involvement methods. A total of 33 nurses in five focus groups, 15 interviews and 32 questionnaires (questionnaire response rate 63%) were needed. Table 1 summarises the participant characteristics. Ninetyfour percent of the participants were female. Most participants were satisfied with their contribution during the involvement methods (mean grade ≥7.5). Fewer interview respondents would use the test (40%) in comparison to the participants from the focus groups and the questionnaire respondents (73% resp. 78%) (p00.02). The questionnaire group included more students from a high training level nursing school than the focus groups and interviews (p0 0.09). We did not observe any other statistically significant group differences in participant characteristics (p>0.1).\n\n\nComparison between involvement methods\n\nDuring the first part of the three involvement methods, participants made 355 remarks, which represented 35 different items that could influence using a test for susceptibility to HE (Table 2; \"Appendix 1\"). Sixteen of the 35 items had a facilitating effect on use, 10 had a hindering effect and nine could have both effects. Seventeen of the 35 items came forward during all three types of involvement methods. Of the 22 literature items, 21 were also spontaneously mentioned in one or more involvement methods; only one literature item, \"religious beliefs\", was not mentioned spontaneously. Ten of the 21 mentioned literature items came spontaneously forward during all involvement methods or were spontaneously mentioned by more than 50% of the participants in at least one involvement method. These 10 items were \"preventive measures\", \"test is redundant: not decisive/definite to acquire HE\", \"test message\", \"curiosity\", \"fear\", \"need to know personal HE risk\", \"have HE\", \"have acquaintance with HE\", \"seriousness of HE\" and \"effects of HE on personal work functioning\" (Table 2). Of the 35 items, we considered 14 to be new in comparison to the literature. Seven of the 14 new items were mentioned during all involvement methods or were mentioned by >50% of the participants in one involvement method. These seven items were \"extrapolating to take preventive measures for family or children\", \"increase knowledge in general\", \"selection of education or work type\", \"low test effort\", \"feelings of (in)security about developing HE\", \"contribution to science\" and \"a test on HE goes too far\".\n\nThroughout the five focus groups, participants made 157 relevant remarks (4.8 remarks per participant), which represented a total of 30 different items (0.9 items per participant). In comparison, the 15 interviewees made 126 remarks (8.4 remarks per participant), which represented 29 items (1.9 items per participant), while the 32 questionnaire respondents made 72 remarks (2.3 remarks per participant), which represented 21 items (0.7 items per participant) (Tables 2 and 3). The interview participants gave significantly more relevant remarks per person than the questionnaire respondents (p < 0.0001). For the focus group participants, such comparison could not be calculated because data was on group level only. The total number of spontaneously mentioned items that were in addition to the items found in literature (in total 14) varied per method: the focus groups revealed 13 new items in relation to the literature, while the interviews revealed 11 and the questionnaires revealed 8.\n\nThe influence on \"others in work\" and a \"low risk skin type\" were exclusively mentioned during the focus groups ( Table 2). The \"interest in genetic diseases in general\" and the \"media forum used\" were solely mentioned during the interviews. The questionnaires did not reveal any new items that were not mentioned in the other two methods. Although several literature items were not mentioned spontaneously during a focus group, interview or questionnaire, they were all confirmed to be relevant for the use of the test during the discussion of the topic list in the second part of the involvement methods.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nPer participant, interviews revealed most barriers and facilitators for using a new genetic test. On average, interview participants produced 1.9 items and 8.4 relevant remarks per participant, in comparison to 0.9 items and 3.8 remarks for focus group participants and 0.7 items and 1.7 remarks for questionnaire respondents. Although interviews revealed more items per participant, the total number of different items was similar to that revealed by the focus groups. Both methods were needed to reveal all different items present in the study population. In total, interviews revealed 29, focus groups 30 and questionnaires only 21 items. All three methods disclosed items that could influence the use of the test that had not been revealed by the literature search.\n\nTo our knowledge, there are only a few studies comparing the output of involvement methods (Fern 1982;Folch-Lyon et al. 1981;Kaplowitz 2000;Ward et al. 1991;Wutich et al. 2010). Kaplowitz (2000) studied the value of mangrove wetlands among residents living in Yucatan, Mexico and compared focus groups and interviews. The authors showed that the interviews revealed more different discussion topics than the focus groups, while we found that the total number of items was about equal. Fern (1982) who compared the number of unique items (ideas) regarding communication strategies or concerns on job opportunities for women suggested in focus groups and interviews 2.7 (1-5) 2.6 (1-4) 2.9 (1-5) Satisfaction with contribution and involvement, scale 0-10 Mean (min-max) 7.8 (4-10) 7.5 (5-10) 7.6 (5-10) Extrapolating to take preventive measures for family or children (+) b <10 10-50 <10\n\nTest result will only lead to more (un)careful preventive behaviour ( concluded that focus group participants produced only 60% to 70% of the items that would have been produced in an individual interview. In our focus groups, participants produced 47% (0.9/1.9 pp) of the items of the interview participants. Unfortunately, both Kaplowitz (2000) and Fern (1982) did not study the differences and similarities of the output contents. Fern (1982) investigated the differences between interviews and questionnaires (\"individuals working alone\") and between questionnaires and focus groups. They also found that interviews revealed more relevant items than questionnaires. However, in contrast to our study, the authors concluded that questionnaires revealed more relevant items than focus groups. Possibly, the complexity of our study topic (genetics and genetic testing) in comparison to the topic of the study of Fern and colleagues (job opportunities for women) could account for the observed differences. Participants in our focus groups and interviews often asked for clarification concerning genetics and genetic testing. The questionnaire participants did not have this opportunity. Clearly, complex topics are less suitable for the detection of new items through questionnaires. Furthermore, combining qualitative methods (triangulation) is mentioned to be an important criterion for finding all different opinions and views in a particular population (Bryman 2001;Denzin and Lincoln 2000;Kvale 1996). Similarly, in our study, both focus groups and interviews were needed to reveal all different items in the study population. The questionnaires did not add any items that were not already mentioned during the other two methods. In contrast to our findings, Folch-Lyon et al. (1981), who compared the attitudes towards contraception in Mexico with focus groups and questionnaires, found no apparent differences between the attitudes (items) revealed by the two methods. Similarly, Ward et al. (1991) who compared the outputs (items) of focus groups and questionnaires of three studies on family planning also found that the outputs of both methods were highly similar. The authors concluded, however, that focus groups brought forward more in depthinformation than questionnaires. Wutich et al. (2010) who compared the output (remark percentage) of these methods about sensitive topics in water-policy development concluded that the methods revealed similar remark percentages when they concerned low or moderately sensitive topics. The authors also concluded that the focus groups could reveal higher statement percentages when discussing very sensitive topics with an opportunity to exchange important information or present a solution. In our study, we discussed hand eczema, an occupational disease that is very common among nurses. Although HE is probably not a very sensitive topic, participants may consider HE to be serious, and viewing the test as an opportunity for HE prevention may have stimulated discussion. Again, the complexity of our study topic may have enlarged the difference between the output per participant of the focus groups and interviews and that of the questionnaires.\n\nThis study is one of the first comparing stakeholder involvement methods on revealing items that could influence the use of a new health-related knowledge product, such as a genetic test. Our study has several limitations. Although we carefully developed the protocols for all three involvement methods based on experience and literature, the reliability and validity of the involvement methods can be affected by the way it is conducted and evaluated. This topic needs some consideration. A limitation could be the effect of the interviewers (MR, MV and MMV) and focus group (MR) moderator on the output (Denzin and Lincoln 2000). Although they are supposed to stimulate discussion, making use of a moderator or interviewer may induce socially desirable answers from the participants. This in turn may decrease the reliability and validity of the findings. Another issue may concern participant recruitment and compensation. We tried to minimize the effects of these issues by standardization between methods, by for example, matching the recruitment technique and the amount of compensation. Also the coding process and its resulting taxonomy was a Remarks and items may influence student nurses' choice to use a genetic test for susceptibility to hand eczema a 25-75 percentiles could only be calculated for interviews and questionnaire as they provide data on the individual level subjective process that included the interpretation of data by MR and MV. Possibly, other researchers would have preferred different domains and items. Furthermore, some items may overlap or fit in more than one domain. Nevertheless, the large differences in output (per participant) between interviews and questionnaires and between focus groups and questionnaires would most likely have remained. Another limitation concerns our method used to establish the point of data saturation and its potential influence on the output per participant. As customary, we established the point of data saturation as part of an ongoing process in data collection. Based on experience, we expected to need between four and six focus groups, between nine and 15 interviews and between 15 and 50 questionnaires to reach saturation. As a rule of thumb we used 30% of the minimum expected number, as the number of successive focus groups, interviews or questionnaires needed to indicate saturation (respectively, 1, 3 and 5). However, we chose to use two subsequent focus groups instead of one because using the output of only one subsequent focus group may be too dependent on chance. One may hypothesize that one focus group with five to eight participants has a larger impact on the output per participant than one individual interview or questionnaire. Nevertheless, a second analysis excluding the last two focus groups, three interviews and five questionnaires shows a largely similar distribution of the number of relevant remarks per participant: 7.5 for focus groups, 10.5 for interviews and 2.7 for questionnaires. Another constraint is the observed group difference in training level and gender. The group of questionnaire respondents included more high training level student nurses (78%) than the focus groups (55%) and interview participants (53%). An expected effect of this difference is that more items and remarks would be revealed in the group with high training level nursing students because they may possibly have had more reflection on this topic. However, a subgroup analysis showed the opposite. A similar analysis on possible effects of gender on the output within the questionnaire group showed that the female respondents revealed a similar amount of items and remarks than male respondents. Next, the percentage of participants that were not willing to use the test was significantly higher for the interviews than for the focus groups and questionnaires. A more thorough inspection of data on individual level showed that not-willing interview participants, on average, revealed more remarks than the participants who were willing or were doubtful. Possibly, interview participants who were not willing to use the test had reflected more extensively on the advantages and disadvantages of the test. However, in the questionnaires, the number of remarks per participant did not show a tendency to differ among the participants who were and who were not willing to use the test. Therefore, it is not clear whether the ratio of participants willing and not willing to use the test influenced the higher number of remarks per participant. Furthermore, the specific nature of our studied research product, a genetic susceptibility test meant for a specific stakeholder group in a specific context, limits the generalisability of our study findings. Still, our findings on the output of different user involvement methods are probably useful when evaluating views of intended users to other genetic tests. We recommend that future research studies repeat our study design for different research products and tools in different contexts. Last, this study only compared the involvement methods on output per participant. Future studies could evaluate the efficiency of the involvement methods more thoroughly, by also addressing the more qualitative aspects of the output, e.g. the quality, depth or breadth, and by including all costs and benefits, e.g. time and effort spent on recruiting participants and transcribing or analysing data. Because in this study questionnaires only revealed a small part of the barriers and facilitators, time spared only using questionnaires was outweighed by the limited output. We estimate that overall, interviews seemed most efficient in terms of cost and benefits. Time spent to recruit participants was in favour of the interviews as we only needed 15 participants. Furthermore, the time needed to prepare and execute the focus groups and interviews was similar, although two researchers were needed to guide the focus groups. We estimate that the time to analyse the output was similar for both methods.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nWe conclude that focus groups, interviews and questionnaires with intended users can all reveal a substantial number of barriers and facilitators to use a new genetic test. In this study, interviews and focus groups both revealed a higher number of items that can influence the use of the genetic test than questionnaires. Interviews and focus groups may be combined to reveal all potential barriers and facilitators in a study population. For the application of a new genetic test in practice, our findings suggest that interviews constitute the most appropriate method as the total of revealed barriers plus facilitators divided by the number of participants was highest. This conclusion may be valid for other health-related research products as well. \n\n\nItems can have a facilitating (+) or hindering (−) effect on the use of a genetic test for susceptibility to hand eczema a Literature items b New items\n\n\nThe following search strategy was applied in MEDLINE via PubMed: (\"Dermatitis, Irritant\" [Mesh] OR \"Dermatitis, Occupational\" [Mesh]) AND (\"Nurses\" [Mesh]) AND (\"Genetic Predisposition to Disease\" [Mesh] OR \"Genetic Testing\" [Mesh]).

The intersected hormonal regulation of ontogenetic processes fosters predictions of steroid-mediated phenotypic integration among sexually dimorphic traits, a statement defied by associations between classical dimorphism predictors (e.g. body size) and traits that apparently lack sex-specific functions (e.g. ratios between the lengths of Digits II and IV -2D:4D). Developmental bases of female-biased 2D:4D have been identified, but these remain unclear for taxa presenting male-biased 2D:4D (e.g. anura). Here we propose two alternative hypotheses to investigate evolution of male-biased 2D:4D associated with sexually dimorphic body size using Leptodactylus frogs: I)'hypothesis of sex-specific digit responses' -Digit IV would be reactive to testosterone but exhibit responses in the opposite direction of those observed in female-biased 2D:4D lineages, so that Digit IV turns shorter in males; II) 'hypothesis of identity of the dimorphic digit'-Digit II would be the dimorphic digit. Results: We compiled the following databases using Leptodactylus frogs: 1) adults of two species from natural populations and 2) testosterone-treated L. fuscus at post-metamorphic stage. Studied traits seem monomorphic in L. fuscus; L. podicipinus exhibits male-biased 2D:4D. When present, 2D:4D dimorphism was male-biased and associated with dimorphic body size; sex differences resided on Digit II instead of IV, corroborating our 'hypothesis of identity of the dimorphic digit'. Developmental steroid roles were validated: testosterone-treated L. fuscus frogs were smaller and exhibited masculinized 2D:4D, and Digit II was the digit that responded to testosterone. Conclusion: We propose a model where evolution of sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D first originates from the advent, in a given digit, of increased tissue sensitivity to steroids. Phenotypic integration with other sexually dimorphic traits would then occur through multi-trait hormonal effects during development. Such process of phenotypic integration seems fitness-independent in its origin and might explain several cases of steroid-mediated integration among sexually dimorphic traits.\n\nBackground\n\nSets of traits can be highly integrated due to functional and/or developmental correlations [1,2]. Hormones likely play essential roles in the evolution of phenotypic integration because they regulate pathways involved in a multitude of developmental processes and transduce environmental signals into developmental responses [3][4][5]. Accordingly, correlated variation among traits might be established through indirect interactions during development mediated by the sharing of a common hormonal environment along specific developmental windows. Multiple-trait effects of hormonal variation are especially evident in sexually dimorphic phenotypes, given that sex steroids (androgens and estrogens) modulate several physiological, morphological and behavioral sex-specific features in vertebrate animals [5][6][7]. Such steroids may also affect the development of traits that apparently lack sex-specific functions, such as digit proportions [8,9]. For example, the ratio between the lengths of Digit II and Digit IV (2D:4D ratio) is sexually dimorphic in several lineages [10], and apparently, differences between males and females in this feature arise from a differentiated sensitivity of specific digits to sex-steroids during development [8,9]. Similar lengths of Digits II and IV result in higher 2D:4D ratios, while lower digit ratios occur when one digit is much longer than the other (Fig. 1) [8][9][10][11]. Historically, sexual dimorphism in the 2D:4D digit ratio has initially been identified in humans [12], and subsequently it became broadly applied as an indirect marker for detecting embryonic effects of sex-steroids on other sexually dimorphic traits, including personality, reproductive success, disease susceptibility, and sexual orientation [12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. This research has been mainly based on correlations among traits, with a few studies combining such correlations with experimental approaches [23][24][25][26]. Results suggest that, once the sensitivity of a given digit to hormonal levels is established, changes on the magnitude of sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D ratios likely represent conspicuous examples of phenotypic integration modulated by hormonal pleiotropy [8,9,[11][12][13]. In addition to humans, an extensive record of correlations between differences in male and female 2D:4D ratios and other sexually dimorphic traits became available for mammals [8][9][10][27][28][29][30][31], birds [10,[32][33][34][35][36][37][38] and lizards [10,[39][40][41][42]. Interestingly, whereas in some species the 2D:4D ratio is larger in females than males (2D:4D female-biased, identified in salamanders, lizards, rodents and some primates, including the chacm baboons, gorillas and some populations of chimpanzees), in other lineages the males exhibit the largest 2D:4D values (2D:4D male-biased, observed in anurans, birds and also some primates, including the guinea baboons and the rhesus macaque [10,41,43]), a variation that suggests some evolutionary lability at the level of digit tissue responses to sex steroids during development ( [41,43]; see also Fig. 1).\n\nThe developmental basis of a female-biased 2D:4D ratio has initially been identified in mice, and resides on a higher concentration of sex-steroid receptors in Digit IV than Digit II, turning the former more sensitive to sexsteroid hormones than the later (i.e., the dimorphic digit is Digit IV [8,9]). In species characterized by a femalebiased 2D:4D ratio, male Digit IV becomes longer in response to androgens (i.e., the ratio is lower), and in females, it is shorter in response to the estrogens, resulting in higher ratios ( [8]; Fig. 1a). In contrast, knowledge of the mechanisms establishing a 2D:4D male-biased pattern, which has been described for example in Anura [41,43], is comparatively much more obscure, and the identity of the dimorphic digit in this pattern remains unknown. Fig. 1 Proposed hypotheses for sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D ratios. a 2D:4D female-biased sexual dimorphism, which consists of larger digit ratios in females (F) than males (M), a pattern explained by Digit IV responding to sex-steroids ('SS', androgens and estrogens); (b and c) two hypotheses proposed here for the establishment of male-biased 2D:4D digit ratios. b Hypothesis I (HI): male-biased patterns are explained by inverted between-sex responses of Digit IV to sex-steroids; thus, Digit IV becomes shorter in males in response to testosterone. c Hypothesis II (HII): male-biased patterns reflect a change in the identity of the digit responding to sex-steroids, not the direction of the response (elongation or shortening); thus, Digit II is the one dimorphic and is longer in males and shorter in females\n\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nThe arousal of sexual dimorphism in digit ratios involves the acquisition of hormone sensitivity by a given digit, and alternative scenarios might produce different dimorphic patterns (male-biased or female-biased). The developmental basis of a female-biased 2D:4D ratio has already been identified [8], and for the establishment of a 2D:4D male-biased, we foresee two alternative hypotheses ( Fig. 1), which are tested here using Leptodactylus frogs. According to the 'hypothesis of sex-specific digit responses' (HI, Fig. 1b), a male-biased pattern would be established similarly to the 2D:4D female-biased configuration, but with Digit IV having a sexually inverse response to androgens and estrogens, which would result in a shorter Digit IV in males. Inverse responses between sexes have been described for other sexually dimorphic traits in tetrapods [6,44], and in the 2D:4D ratio these would produce a configuration reverse to the femalebiased pattern. This scenario predicts adult males having a smaller Digit IV than females and exposure to increased testosterone concentrations would result in post-metamorphic frogs presenting a shorter Digit IV than the control. Our alternative 'hypothesis of identity of the dimorphic digit' (HII, Fig. 1c) postulates that the 2D:4D male-biased pattern reflects changes in the identity of the dimorphic digit. Accordingly, Digit II, instead of IV, would respond to differences in sex steroid concentrations, becoming longer in males and shorter in females. The prediction derived from this hypothesis prognoses adult males having a longer Digit II than females, and exposure to increased testosterone concentrations during development would result in postmetamorphic frogs having a longer Digit II than the control. Given the multi-trait effects of hormonal levels during development, it is likely that in Anura the digit ratio 2D:4D is associated with body size because of phenotypic integration modulated by hormonal pleiotropy, a prediction accessed here using testosterone as a proxy for circulating sex-steroids during development.\n\nInformation on the hormonal environment of developing anurans derives mostly from studies performed with Xenopus laevis, which eggs present high concentrations of sex steroids hormones with maternal origin [45]. As development progresses to prometamorphosis stages (Gosner stages 36-40), a pattern of enzyme activity, male-and female-specific, is established, and sex steroid and steroid-receptors concentrations in specific tissues reach a peak that leads to integrated secondary sexual determination involving sexual differentiation of gonads and brain [45]; during these stages, major events of digit growth differentiation are being established [8,61]. Modulation of phenotypic integration by testosterone is therefore expected, due to the multi-trait effects of this hormone in male development [3][4][5][6][7] that often include variation in body size [44]. In Anura, most species comprise female-biased body size dimorphism, a pattern likely derived from adaptive differences between sexes in life history traits [46][47][48][49][50]. The developmental bases for body size dimorphism in Anura remain unknown [49,50], but it is possible that testosterone inhibits male growth in species that are female-biased for body size, as previously reported for other taxa [44]. If body size and 2D:4D ratios are phenotypically integrated through the multi-trait effects of testosterone in Anura, sexual dimorphism in the 2D:4D ratio should be coupled with variation in body size, a correlation expected both in adults from natural populations and in tadpoles raised under increased testosterone concentrations.\n\nIn this study, two databases were combined to test the hypotheses we envisage for explaining the evolution of male-biased 2D:4D ratios ( Fig. 1b and c). We focus on Anura, a clade where male-biased 2D:4D ratios have been previously reported [39,43,51], and we use frogs from the family Leptodactylidae, a lineage where the presence and magnitude of overall sexual dimorphism vary considerably among species [52][53][54]. Phenotypic integration between body size and the 2D:4D ratio in Anura has also been evaluated, inferring the putative role of testosterone as a developmental regulator in the establishment of female-biased body size dimorphism in anurans. Our databases comprised 1) adults from natural populations of Leptodactylus podicipinus and L. fuscus and 2) testosterone-treated tadpoles of L. fuscus. While L. podicipinus has been described as clearly dimorphic for several traits [53,54], L. fuscus is a species easily maintained in captivity that apparently has a weak dimorphic signature characterized by similar body sizes between sexes and by the absence of the male reproductive thumb spine observed in most leptodactylid frogs [53,54]. A database comprising one possibly monomorphic and one dimorphic species grants the ideal experimental design for testing the role of testosterone in phenotypic integration because variation in dimorphic signals within Leptodactylus may reside in species-specific dynamics of the hormonal milieu. Identification of dimorphic patterns in Leptodactylus podicipinus will nurture comparisons between our two postulated hypotheses ( Fig. 1b and c), while the advent of masculinized patterns in the monomorphic L. fuscus elicited by testosterone manipulation will validate the developmental role of this hormone in phenotypic integration of dimorphic traits in Anura. As a major outcome from this study, we use our results to propose a model for Tetrapoda that can explain the evolution of sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D and other digit ratios under the scenario of phenotypic integration.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nNatural populations of Leptodactylus podicipinus and L. fuscus\n\nThe dataset of L. podicipinus comprised 373 adult specimens (191 females and 182 males) from herpetological collections that were sampled in localities from six different Brazilian states (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The specimens measured were part of collection lots comprising animals collected from 1970 to 2008 and deposited at the following Brazilian collections: DZSRP-UNESP; MZUSP-USP; Herpetological Collection Célio F.B. Haddad; collection from the Laboratory of Taxonomy, Systematic and Evolution of Neotropical Anurans at UFMG. The dataset of L. fuscus comprised 49 adult specimens (25 females and 24 males) sampled in two localities at different Brazilian states (Additional file 1: Figure S1). We sampled different sites to minimize population bias, since the presence and magnitude of sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D may vary among populations [10,15,39]. The lengths of Digits II and IV were measured in the hind limbs (right and left sides) using a digital caliper (Mitutoyo, Illinois, USA, accuracy of 0.01 mm), which was also used to measure the Snout-Vent Length (SVL) of each specimen. All measurements were taken by the same person (L.L.). After identifying which digit was sexually dimorphic in natural populations of Leptodactylus frogs (see results), we obtained digital X-rays (Faxitron LX-60) from adult specimens and measured the length of digit elements (Fig. 2c) in the dimorphic digit (see results) using the software ImageJ [55]. All morphological traits (lengths of Digit II, Digit IV, phalanges of Digit II, and SVL) were log10 transformed prior to calculations, and the digit ratio 2D:4D was calculated individually for front and hind limbs, by dividing length of Digit II by the length of Digit IV, as commonly reported in the current literature [11]. The effect of body size on digit lengths was corrected through a regression analysis [56] of each variable on SVL, and then the statistical analyzes were performed from extracted residuals.\n\n\nTreatments with testosterone levels in Leptodactylus fuscus\n\nTadpoles of L. fuscus comprised two clutches collected on the campus of University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto (state of São Paulo, Brazil) in December 2014. Animals were collected under ICMBio permit 32,862-1, following protocols from IUCN [57], and the experimental procedures were implemented according to the Animal Research Committee of University of São Paulo (CEUA/USP). Tadpoles from the two clutches of L. fuscus were mixed in the lab and randomly distributed into six aquariums (4 L water each), corresponding to duplicates for each of the three following conditions: 1) treatment with testosterone hormone (17α-methyltestosterone, IcquaImagem) and vehicle solution (absolute ethanol); 2) Control A, with only the vehicle solution (absolute ethanol); 3) Control B, comprising animals raised only in water, without exogenous testosterone or vehicle solution. Conditions 1 and 2 consisted of tadpoles first immersed in tanks with 1 l of water for 12 h, and then at the testosterone treatment 500 μg of 17α-methyltestosterone was diluted in absolute ethanol (adjusted to 0.05% ethanol /1 L), while in Control A, the vehicle solution alone (ethanol = 0.05% ethanol/1 L) was added to the water; in Control B (only water), the tadpoles were simply maintained at their initial condition (tanks with 1 l of water). Testosterone concentrations and treatment procedures followed the literature available for sex reversals [58][59][60]. Experiments started at developmental stage 28, which is characterized by early bud limb development according to the Gosner developmental table for anurans [61], and ended at stage 42, which comprises the beginning of the metamorphic stage [61]. Every 48 h, the procedures reported for the testosterone treatment and Control A were repeated (i.e., solutions at the aforementioned concentrations were added to the aquaria water). After reaching stage 42 [61], solutions (testosterone + vehicle or vehicle only) were not added to the water anymore, and the animals were maintained in the aquaria until the end of metamorphosis (post-metamorphic stage). The developmental windows chosen to apply the testosterone treatments embrace major events of autopodium and digit development in anurans, and therefore represent a time frame likely sensitive to hormonal manipulations, especially because gonadal development occurs at these same developmental stages [45,[61][62][63]. At the post-metamorphic stage, the animals were killed using an overdose of anesthetic lidocaine, and specimens were fixed in formalin (15%) and ethanol (70%).\n\nMeasurements in post metamorphic frogs were performed in digital photos using ImageJ software [55]. The same traits measured in adult Leptodactylus specimens from natural populations were also obtained in the L. fuscus juveniles (24 individuals treated with testosterone, 20 individuals in the Control A group, and 25 individuals in the Control B group): lengths of Digits II and IV of the hind limbs (right and left sides) and the Snout-Vent Length (SVL). Phalangeal lengths of Digit II were measured in postmetamorphic frogs as corresponding to the distance between phalangeal calluses [64]. The acquisition and processing of morphological data in post-metamorphic frogs were performed likewise to the data from adult specimens (see details of these procedures in the Methods \n\n\nStatistical analyses\n\nStatistical analyses were performed in R software [65]; graphics were designed in GraphPad Prism v.5 [66]. After confirming symmetry between the left and right sides using a paired t-test (see Additional file 1: Table S1) we performed all analyses using data from the right hind limb.\n\nIn adults from natural populations of Leptodactylus frogs, we first tested whether the two species studied were sexually dimorphic in the 2D:4D ratio and body size. We also tested which was the dimorphic digit to confirm whether dimorphism in these species was malebiased and to compare evidence for the hypotheses we postulated (Fig. 1b and c). A two-way ANOVA was performed separately for each species; the lengths of Digit II and Digit IV, the 2D:4D ratio, and the SVL were dependent variables, while sex and locality were included as factors. Subsequently, we applied a one-way ANOVA to the phalangeal lengths (dependent variable) using sex as a factor to test which digit elements explained the observed dimorphism.\n\nTo test the effect of testosterone levels on the establishment of 2D:4D ratios and body size during ontogeny, we obtained data for Leptodactylus fuscus at the postmetamorphic stage in animals raised at one of the following three conditions: 1) treated with testosterone in ethanol solution; 2) Control A and 3) Control B. The following morphological traits were compared among individuals raised under these three conditions using one-way ANOVAs: lengths of Digit II and Digit IV, lengths of the distal and proximal phalanges of Digit II, the 2D:4D ratio, and the SVL. Post hoc Bonferroni comparisons were applied.\n\nIn this study, we also tested for phenotypic integration between the digit ratio 2D:4D and body size in Leptodactylus frogs. We calculated a sexual dimorphism index (SDI) for the digit ratio (SDI-2D:4D) and for body size (SDI-SVL) for each sampled locality of the sexually dimorphic species (L. podicipinus, see results) following the current literature [67]. Spearman-correlation tests were then performed to test for significant associations between SDI-2D:4D and SDI-SVL in each locality. Statistically significant associations were interpreted as evidence for phenotypic integration between the two traits, likely mediated by multi-trait hormonal modulation during ontogeny.\n\n\nResults\n\nThe male-biased 2D:4D dimorphic pattern is determined by the identity of the dimorphic digit\n\nIn natural populations of L. podicipinus, the digit ratio 2D:4D is sexually dimorphic (F 1, 366 = 38.715, p < 0.001; Fig. 2a), while in L. fuscus it seems monomorphic (F 1, 46 = 0.063, p = 0.801; Fig. 2a). The dimorphic pattern detected in L. podicipinus 2D:4D digit ratio is male-biased as follows: males exhibit larger relative ratios than females (Fig. 2a). Such differences between sexes are settled in the relative length of Digit II, which is significantly longer in males than in females of L. podicipinus (F 1, 366 = 15.873, p < 0.001; Fig. 2a). The relative length of Digit IV, in contrast, does not differ between males and females of this species (F 1, 366 = 1.407, p = 0.236; Fig. 2a). Between-sex differences in Digit II, instead of Digit IV, corroborate the 'hypothesis of identity of the dimorphic digit'. We then used X-ray images to test which digit elements explain the sexually dimorphic pattern identified in L. podicipinus and found that males have a longer proximal phalanx of Digit II than females (F 1, 19 = 6.633, p = 0.024; Fig. 2b and c).\n\nWe also evaluated the developmental role of testosterone in the establishment of 2D:4D digit ratios and body size. Specifically, we exposed tadpoles of Leptodactylus fuscus, a species monomorphic for 2D:4D digit ratios that is easily maintained in captivity, to increased concentrations of testosterone based on protocols of sexual reversion [58][59][60]. We used the following two controls: control A = addition of ethanol solution to the water, and control B = tadpoles raised in water without any vehicle/ethanol. The patterns resulting from experimental treatments with testosterone are coherent with the 'hypothesis of identity of the dimorphic digit' , which has already been supported by data from adult specimens of L. podicipinus from natural populations. Recently metamorphosed individuals from the group treated with testosterone at the larval stage exhibited masculinized 2D:4D digit ratios (F 2, 66 = 48.099, p < 0.001; Fig. 2d); the two control treatments produced similar phenotypes between each other (p = 0.140; Fig. 2d). Only Digit II responded to manipulations of hormonal levels and became longer in animals treated with testosterone (F 2,66 = 42.979, p < 0.001; control groups did not differ from each other in post hoc comparisons p = 0.524; Fig.  2d). Testosterone had no effect on Digit IV (F 2,66 = 0.3886, p = 0.5351; Fig. 2d). Similar to our observations in adults of L. podicipinus, the digital element that responded to variation in hormonal levels was the proximal phalanx of Digit II (F 2,27 = 11.538, p < 0.001; control groups did not differ from each other in post hoc comparisons: p = 0.990; results from testosterone treatments differed from Control A (p = 0.018) and Control B (p = 0.025); Fig. 2e). Altogether, these results corroborate the hypothesis that a 2D:4D male-biased pattern of sexually dimorphic digit ratios derives from a taxon-specific change in the identity of the digit that is sensitive to the levels to sex steroids during ontogeny.\n\nSexual dimorphism in body size is coupled with malebiased 2D:4D digit ratios in L. podicipinus, and testosterone induces masculinized body sizes and digit ratios in tadpoles of the monomorphic L. fuscus\n\nOur results also provided evidence for phenotypic integration between 2D:4D ratios and body size, likely hormonally modulated by testosterone levels during larval development. The species L. podicipinus is sexually dimorphic for body size, and females are significantly bigger than males (F 1,366 = 231.470, p < 0.001). Congruent with our findings for L. fuscus, digit ratios, males and females of this species do not differ in body size (F 1,46 = 1.832, p = 0.182). In addition, the sexual dimorphism identified in L. podicipinus differed in magnitude among localities (see Additional file 1: Table S2), and individuals from localities characterized by larger values of the Sexual Dimorphism Index in Digit Ratios (SDI-2D:4D) also exhibit larger values of the Sexual Dimorphism Index in Body Size (SDI-SVL) (Spearman correlation: r = 0.9429, p = 0.017; Fig. 3a), an association that suggests phenotypic integration among traits. The role of testosterone acting as a modulator of phenotypic integration was corroborated in the experimental treatments performed with L. fuscus tadpoles. Individuals treated with higher testosterone concentrations during development were significantly smaller than both controls (F 2,66 = 14.361, p < 0.001). Significant correlations between SVL and the digit ratio 2D:4D were only identified among individuals treated with testosterone (r = 0.397, p = 0.027; Fig. 3b), an association not detected in the controls (Control A: r = 0.077, p = 0.405; Control B: r = −0.120, p = 0.252). Altogether, our databases suggest that testosterone is a major regulator of the establishment of female-biased body size and male-biased 2D:4D digit ratios in Leptodactylus frogs and that it is a very likely promoter of phenotypic integration in Anura.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nDimorphic patterns in the digit ratio 2D:4D, coupled with sexual dimorphism in other phenotypic traits, such as body size, provide broad evidence for ontogenetic phenotypic integration mediated by steroid hormones circulating during development [8,. Hormonal pleiotropic effects are often responsible for constrains at different biological levels [3][4][5][6][7], which may persist along the entire ontogeny [68,69]. Evolutionary processes that involve a dissociation between variation in the hormonal milieu and the response capacity of specific tissues apparently consent changes in hormonally regulated traits that disregard variation in the hormone concentrations per se, circumventing possible pleiotropic effects derived from changes in the hormonal milieu [5,6]. Here, we propose that the initial establishment of a sex-differential sensibility of digit tissues to circulating hormones may not depend on primary milieu changes per se. The observed integration between digit ratios and other sexually dimorphic traits [8, would therefore be secondary, assuming a coalesced modulation by hormonal concentrations after the initial advent of a differential digit sensitivity to circulating hormones. Based on our results from Leptodactylus frogs, together with current literature, we propose a model to explain the origin and evolution of female and male-biased patterns of sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D digit ratios that is illustrated in Fig. 4. Our model states that, once the dimorphism in digit ratios arises during evolution (Fig. 4, blue arrows), it becomes phenotypically integrated with other sexually dimorphic traits (Fig. 4, orange arrows) because changes in the hormonal milieu that regulates different developmental processes will affect traits that ancestrally were not correlated. However, the occurrence of sexual dimorphism in digit ratios and the direction of its patterns (i.e., male-biased or female-biased) depend primarily on the existence of a given digit being more sensitive to hormone concentrations than the others (Fig. 4, blue arrows). Such difference in hormone sensitivity would be established by increased concentrations of steroid receptors in that digit and, since it is possible that this initial change in digit sensitivity to steroids did not directly affect survival or reproductive success, the advent of enhanced sensitivity of digit development to steroids might have been fitness-independent on its origin or, in other words, neutral to fitness [6].\n\nIllustrating the pleiotropic effects of testosterone during development, our results shed light on the mechanistic basis of body size sexual dimorphism in anurans: testosterone treatments in the monomorphic L. fuscus rescued patterns of female-biased body sizes and malebiased digit ratios identified in natural populations of L. podicipinus, and body size was correlated to digit ratios in hormone-treated tadpoles. Our results agree with current literature [3,44] and indicate that testosterone may play a major role in the determination of femalebiased body size dimorphism in Anura, an association also described in other vertebrate lineages, as Squamata [44]. Further investigation on hormonally mediated tradeoffs between early sexual maturity and survival in natural populations seems promising, as it is possible that testosterone represses growth in anuran males as a collateral effect of early maturation [44,[46][47][48][49][50].\n\nThe contrast between an apparent absence of sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D digit ratios and body size in adults of L. fuscus from natural populations and the testosteroneinduced phenotypic changes in both traits on L. fuscus tadpoles deserves a more detailed discussion. Although sexual dimorphism has not been detected in digit ratios or body size of L. fuscus adults, our experimental approach provides evidence for the capacity of tissue responses to sex steroids in the species. One possible explanation is that the circulating testosterone concentrations in L. fuscus tadpoles are not high enough to surpass the threshold necessary for triggering dimorphic patterns, despite the tissue capacity for responding to hormonal variation. When testosterone is present at higher concentrations, as those applied in our experimental treatments (see also [58][59][60]), this threshold is surpassed, and integrated variation in phenotypic traits modulated by the hormonal milieu is then observed. Future studies characterizing circulating steroid levels in tadpoles and clutch foams of Leptodactylus may clarify if different patterns of sexual dimorphism between the two Leptodactylus species studied here reflect variation in hormonal developmental environments.\n\nThe correlated variation between body size and digit ratios in adults of L. podicipinus and testosteronetreated L. fuscus tadpoles has been interpreted here under a model where phenotypic integration could be established through indirect interactions during development mediated by the sharing of a common hormonal environment along specific developmental windows. In Leptodactylus, male-biased 2D:4D digit ratios apparently originated from a differential sensibility of Digit II developing tissues to circulating testosterone (Hypothesis of changes in the identity of the dimorphic digit, see Fig. 1c), instead of Digit IV being sensitive to hormones, as described in female-biased species and predicted by our Hypothesis I (Hypothesis of sex-specific digit responses, see Fig. 1b). The advent of increased b Correlation between body size (SVL) and 2D:4D digit ratios of L. fuscus tadpoles in three conditions: treated with testosterone (black), Control A (white) and Control B (grey); all measurements were taken in millimeters sensitivity in one specific digit could evolve through changes in steroid receptors concentrations in specific phalanges of that digit (see [8,9]). Once established, the identity of the digit that is sensitive to steroids apparently becomes inalterable in that given organism, and experimental manipulations of sex steroids modify the magnitude of digit ratio dimorphism and may originate sex-bias, but never change the taxa-specific pattern or the identity of the dimorphic digit [10,32,36,37,40,70,71]. Along with such observation, several species of primates, birds, frogs and lizards experienced secondary losses of sexual dimorphism in digit ratios that were not coupled with loss of sexual dimorphism in other traits [10,34,38,43]. Such information assemblage reinforces our proposition that the identity of the digit that becomes dimorphic due to differential sensitivity to circulating steroids is not dependent of the hormonal developmental environment per se, even if the associations between sexual dimorphism in digit ratios and other traits reflect sex-steroid pleiotropy [8,9]. If true, sexual dimorphism in digit ratios might not be the direct target of selection, unless dimorphic digits reflect differential performance between males and females (see [42]). Consequently, the origin of sexual dimorphism in a given digit length might be neutral to fitness [6]; because sexually dimorphic patterns in digit ratios would initially be hidden from selection, the system would be permissive to considerable variation among lineages in the patterns and magnitudes of the dimorphism (Fig. 4). This 'fitness-independent model' is not only applicable to explain the evolution of male and female-biased 2D:4D digit ratios [10,41,43], but may also elucidate the occurrence of sexual dimorphism Fig. 4 Hypothetic model of the evolution of digit ratio dimorphism modulated by multi-trait hormonal effects on developmental pathways. Acquisition of higher sensitivity to sex steroids in specific digits (indicated by stars, Digit II or IV) is initially independent of hormonal concentrations per se (see blue arrows), and the identity of dimorphic digits seems labile among tetrapod lineages (small black arrows among digits). The advent of sexual dimorphism in digit ratios evolves independently of variation in the hormonal milieu (blue arrows), and such trajectory results on a diversity of patterns of digit ratio dimorphism in Tetrapoda. Once the sensibility of a dimorphic digit to steroids is present in the lineage, the length of the digit (and consequently the digit ratio) changes in response to variations in hormonal concentrations and together with others traits that are also hormonally-regulated (doted black arrows).Multi-trait effects of circulating steroids during development (orange lines and arrows) establish correlated variation between digit ratios and other dimorphic traits in other digit ratios, such as 3D:4D and 2D:3D [40,41,43], contributing also to the elucidation of other processes, for example involving the loss of sexual dimorphism in digit ratios in species that remain sexually dimorphic for other traits [10,34,38,43]. Indeed, our model predicts that further research using other tetrapod lineages will find additional evidence supporting the alternative digit ratio patterns just mentioned.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe difference between lineages that exhibit a malebiased 2D:4D and those characterized by a femalebiased 2D:4D resides on the identity of the dimorphic digit responding to steroids during development. In lineages such as Anura, which exhibit male-biased 2D:4D, it is the Digit II, instead of IV, that is sexually dimorphic and steroid-responsive. Dimorphism in digit ratios is developmentally correlated with variation in body size in anurans, an association identified in Leptodactylus natural populations and validated by experiments exposing developing tadpoles to increased testosterone concentrations. We provide evidence that testosterone plays a major role in the establishment of such phenotypic integration, and likely rules the evolution of female-biased body size dimorphism in Anura. We combined our findings with current literature to propose an explanatory model for the origin and evolution of the sexual dimorphism in digit ratios. Specifically, we propose that a first event leading to the advent in a given digit of increased tissue sensitivity to steroids would then engender phenotypic integration of digit ratios with other sexually dimorphic traits. Such model explains the apparent lack of specific functions associated to variation in digit ratios, the diversity of dimorphic patterns evolving in different tetrapod lineages, and the profusion of alternative digit ratio dimorphism in tetrapods (3D:4D, 2D:3D). The posterior establishment of phenotypic integration between digit ratios and other sexually dimorphic traits would occur through multi-trait hormonal effects during development. In other words, the advent of digit sensitivity that results in dimorphism of digit ratios would constitute a discrete event, which is not necessarily connected to its developmental association with other dimorphic traits. Extension of current research programs to incorporate the proposed model might produce the following outcomes: i) identification of more lineages exhibiting male or female-biased 2D:4D dimorphism; ii) inclusion of alternative digit ratios (3D:4D, 2D:3D) in studies investigating evolution of intersected dimorphism among traits; iii) comprehension of cases where dimorphism in digit ratios have been lost while sexual dimorphism remained present.\n\n\nAdditional file\n\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

In clinical genetics, the doctor's office defined a secluded space for discussion of sensitive reproductive options in cases of elevated risk for genetic disorders in individuals or their offspring. When prenatal screening for all pregnant women became conceivable, the potential increase in scale made social and ethical concerns relevant for the whole of society. Whereas genetic testing in clinical genetic practice was widely accepted, prenatal screening at a population level met with unease. Concerns were raised regarding social pressure to screen: the sum of individual choice might result in a 'collective eugenics'. The government's involvement also raised suspicion: actively offering screening evoked associations with eugenic population policies from the first half of the 20th century. By reconstructing elements of policy and public debate on prenatal screening in the Netherlands from the past 30 years, this article discusses how the government has gradually changed its role in balancing the interest of the individual and the collective on genetic reproductive issues. Against a background of increasing knowledge about and demand for prenatal screening among the population, governmental policy changed from focusing on protection by banning screening toward facilitating screening in a careful and ethically sound way by providing adequate information, decision aids and quality assessment instruments. In the meanwhile, invigorating democracy in public debate may entail discussing concepts of 'the good life' in relation to living with or without impairments and dealing with genetic information about oneself or one's offspring.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the years 2010 and 2011, revolutionary steps in noninvasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) were reported. It is now possible to sequence cell-free foetal DNA in maternal serum to detect Down syndrome, and in principle, it should also be possible to detect many more genetic disorders (Chiu et al. 2011;Lo et al. 2010;Fan and Quake 2010). Although the first proof-of-principle NIPD tests are especially targeted at women who have high risk of carrying a foetus with Down syndrome, it is envisaged that in the near future such tests would become available for all pregnant women. The uptake of diagnostic testing is currently partly constrained because of the risk of iatrogenic abortion induced by invasive chorionic villus sampling or amniotic fluid test. To date serum screening can only assess risk for neural tube defects and Down syndrome. If these risk assessment tests were replaced by highly reliable noninvasive tests more women might opt for testing. Would NIPD testing become routinely available, this would mean a new phase in a long process of increasing possibilities to detect foetal abnormalities in pregnant women that started in the 1950s.\n\nWhenever new technological options, such as genetic tests, become available often political and public debates are called for to discuss the social and ethical ramifications. The advent of NIPD led a commentator in the journal Nature to state: 'That possibility challenges all societies to decide for which ends and by what means they want such tests to be used' (Greely 2011). Similar debates took place in earlier phases of introducing and expanding prenatal genetic testing and screening. In this article, we will reflect on the dynamics of the discussion on these issues in the Netherlands during the past 30 years. Whereas other authors have written on prenatal screening in the Netherlands (Stemerding and van Berkel 2001;Toom and van Berkel 2003;Popkema and Harbers 2005;Meijer et al. 2010) and we have outlined these discussions before (van El et al. 2010a), 1 the focus of this account will be on the tension between individual considerations versus collective ramifications regarding certain technologies. Whereas reproduction is key to any society, balancing the tension between the interest of the individual and the collective regarding genetic reproductive issues is a delicate issue in modern democracies and a challenge for governmental policy making. The use or misuse of genetics by individuals or institutions in the first half of the previous century still sets the background of present-day arguments. 2 The Netherlands is well-suited for a case study to explore balancing this tension. The country has an up-to-date health care system providing adequate basic services to the whole population while enabling the provision of extra services of personal preference; thereby, there is a mix of continental and American health care systems. The Dutch public domain has elements of Christian moral principles as well as socialdemocratic and more liberal influences, necessitating dialogue and seeking consensus. This public domain operates at a relative distance from the government. Coalition governments try to respect the views of their rank and file supporters as well as integrate various standpoints into generally accepted policy.\n\nFor our research, we interviewed stakeholders, organised a so-called witness seminar with 20 stakeholders who had been active in genetic testing or screening and/or related policy issues (van El et al. 2010b), collected archival material, studied the clippings archive of VU University and collected articles in Dutch medical journals on the subject of genetic testing and screening.\n\nWe will briefly discuss three occasions during the second half of the 1980s on which genetic testing and screening for reproductive issues became subject of wider attention, and were discussed in medical journals, newspapers and/or television programmes. In addition, we will discuss new regulation during the 1990s, and changes in policy, as well as public and professional views during the 2000s.\n\n\nFrom genetic testing to genetic screening\n\nThe recent decades have witnessed increasing possibilities for genetic testing and screening. In the Netherlands, since the 1970s, individuals and their family members could obtain genetic counselling for their own risk or diagnosis of a serious genetic disorder or that of their offspring. At this time, a foundation was laid for what was later to become the specialty of clinical genetics (Nelis 1998). Consensus on the standards of the developing profession was formulated by a relatively small group of medical professionals and experts of the Health Council of the Netherlands (1977;1980) and was supported by representatives of emerging patient organisations. In the intimacy of the consultation room, a secluded space was defined, where doctors and patients could discuss sensitive reproductive options in case of an elevated risk for genetic or congenital disorders.\n\nDuring the 1980s, it became increasingly clear that new techniques might enable mass screening of pregnant women. Maternal serum screening tests were developed to detect neural tube defects, and a few years later, Down syndrome, in a foetus. This potential increase of scale meant that discussions on reproductive options were no longer confined to the secluded space of a doctor-patient relationship, but that prenatal testing and screening had become relevant issues for the whole society.\n\nDiscussing genetic testing and screening for reproductive issues\n\n\nBetter than God\n\nIn the Netherlands, the public awareness of developments in genetic research and testing was greatly influenced by a documentary series, Better than God, which appeared on television in 1987. The series discussed ongoing develop-ments in genetic research and testing, and questioned whether handicapped people would still be welcome in future society. The series was discussed in newspapers, the director, Wim Kayzer, was interviewed and the connection between modern genetics and eugenic practices during the Second World War was readily made by him and journalists (e.g. Pols 1987).\n\nIn this climate of increased awareness and anxiety about developments in genetics, two reports on reproductive issues appeared that stirred political and public discussion setting the stage for the subsequent policies in the 1990s.\n\n\nPrevention of hereditary and congenital anomalies\n\nIn December 1987, the Department of Health of the Netherlands published a report on the prevention of hereditary and congenital anomalies (Parliamentary documentation 1987(Parliamentary documentation -1988a. The department wished to formulate a comprehensive prevention policy by integrating knowledge of various forms of risk for the mother and the foetus. These ranged from lifestyle issues (such as diet and the teratogenic effects of substances such as alcohol, tobacco and medicines), to infectious diseases. In doing so, the department also responded to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s initiative 'Health for all by the year 2000' (WHO 1981) by calling upon national governments to reduce morbidity and mortality. In an effort to be comprehensive, the Department of Health report included a section on the use of genetic services. Genetic counselling was mentioned as one of several measures to reduce morbidity and mortality, and abortion of an affected foetus was circumscribed as a form of 'secondary prevention'. Clinical genetic centres would enable parents to enact 'responsible parenthood'. The report stated that people should decide for themselves what they meant by that term, its meaning was not further elaborated. However, the term was used in a section in which the societal cost or burden was also mentioned in relation to 'optimizing the chance of a good outcome of reproductive behaviour' (Parliamentary documentation 1987(Parliamentary documentation -1988a. This might have been perceived as a governmental viewpoint favouring abortion as a cost-effective option.\n\nThe Parliament issued a call for reactions, after which they received responses from among others the patient organisation, as well as the professional organisation for clinical geneticists. Several newspapers and magazines covered the reactions to the report and the subsequent debate in Parliament. An important objection to the report for members of Parliament, clinical geneticists, journalists and an ethicist, concerned the terminology, as genetic services were associated with the notion of 'responsible parenthood', and 'optimizing the outcome of reproductive behaviour'. Interestingly, in the 1970s some of the same terms had been used without stirring controversy, such as the term 'responsible parenthood'. The fact that genetic counselling was placed more explicitly under the heading of prevention policy, as well as raised awareness due to the documentary series, may explain the difference in response (van El et al. 2007(van El et al. , 2010a. In addition, the suggested aim of genetic counselling to reduce morbidity and mortality raised criticism. In genetic counselling, it is essential that patients be adequately informed so they can choose for themselves (informed decision making) whether or not to test and consider aborting an affected foetus in accordance with their own values and personal circumstances. Although reduction of the number of children born with a handicap may be an effect of genetic counselling, it is clearly not its aim, as was argued by an ethicist and secretary of the Health Council (De Wert and Engel 1988). Unintentionally, the impression had been raised that the government wanted to use genetic services to improve public health and reduce the costs of health care through preventive abortion of foetuses with severe handicaps. Members of Parliament and journalists wondered whether the government might be considering eugenic policies, and were concerned that people should still have the right not to be tested (Reformatorisch Dagblad 1988). In May 1988, the Minister and State Secretary of Health reassured the members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health that there was no need to be concerned about the government's policy on prenatal testing and the position of handicapped people in Dutch society. The birth of a handicapped child would never be regarded as a case of failed prevention (Parliamentary documentation 1987(Parliamentary documentation -1988b.\n\nThe arguments in the public debate show that it was deemed problematic to subsume prenatal testing or screening and abortion under the heading of a prevention policy. A more careful policy was suggested to accommodate the specific sensitivities and requirements for various kinds of screening (Parliamentary documentation 1987(Parliamentary documentation -1988c. As a consequence of these discussions in governmental documents, more attention was given to terminology. Ethicists at the Ministry of Health became more closely involved in preparing policy documents.\n\n\nPrenatal screening\n\nIn the beginning of the 1980s, the Health Council of the Netherlands was asked to report on the possibilities for prenatal screening. Screening tests had become available to measure the level of alpha foetoprotein in maternal blood as an estimate of the risk of the foetus having a neural tube defect. By the end of 1988, the Health Council of the Netherlands (1988) published a report advising the government to start a pilot programme for serum screening. However, the advice was not unanimous. An influential geneticist at the time, Hans Galjaard, opposed the idea. He was the first chairman of the committee preparing the report, but stepped aside and published a minority standpoint at the end of the report (Health Council of the Netherlands 1988). One of his concerns was that the decentralised organisation of prenatal care in the Netherlands, mostly in the hands of midwives in primary care, left little time for retesting and follow-up after the first screening test in the sixteenth week of pregnancy. He also considered the bad test characteristics as problematic as false positive outcomes could cause unnecessary anxiety in pregnant women. Another issue that was brought up by him on various occasions was the fact that the risk assessment of genetic screening tests did not meet the standards of prenatal diagnosis. He was concerned that the public trust in genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis-something that he had carefully helped to establish in the previous years-would be undermined (van El et al. 2010a,b).\n\nIn 1989, the Dutch government decided not to implement maternal serum screening for neural tube defects (Parliamentary documentation 1989(Parliamentary documentation -1990a. The decision was based on the WHO criteria written by Wilson and Jungner (1968). The test characteristics were found to be inadequate; there were too many false positives and false negatives. Since there was no treatment available, the criterion that only treatable disorders should be screened was not met. The test was considered to be unacceptable for the Dutch population. In a case of a positive test result, further invasive testing might cause an iatrogenic abortion. This was an ethical limit the government did not want to cross. Furthermore, psychological strain and medicalisation were mentioned as casting shadows over the 'joyful period of pregnancy'. The government explicitly mentioned its concern that pressure from health care workers or public opinion might constrain the option of not taking a test. The government's involvement might exert an 'important influence' in that respect (Parliamentary Documentation 1989-1990a. In Parliament, all parties from the left to right wing, including parties representing Christian denominations supported the government's decision not to implement screening (Parliamentary Documentation 1989-1990b.\n\nDutch obstetric health care professionals were divided concerning the screening test. In the north of the Netherlands, screening had been offered on a small scale on a research basis. Obstetricians in that area had expected to continue or expand that practice. In 1990, at an obstetric conference to which foreign experts had been invited, pleas were made regarding serum screening (Mantingh et al. 1991). In the Dutch Journal for Midwives, the subject was heavily debated. The professional organisation, the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, decided not to support serum screening. Patient organisations were also divided. The Council for Handicapped People (Gehandicaptenraad) did not favour prenatal genetic screening, but the patient organisation for children with spastic disorders, BOSK, which included a group of parents of children with neural tube defects, was interested in the test, in principle.\n\nMeanwhile, it had become clear that the test for neural tube defects could also be used to assess the risk for Down syndrome, namely by detecting low levels of alpha fetoprotein. A new round of governmental enquiry and requests for research began. In 1992, the Ethical Committee of the Department of Health advising on research applications (KEMO) was asked to consult on a project of the obstetricians in the northern and central regions of the Netherlands to offer screening for neural tube defects and Down syndrome and study the ethical and psychological aspects of such screening. KEMO had no ethical objections to this type of research. However, it mentioned that this might actually not be seen as population screening in the sense of an offer without a prior medical condition. Since the women were pregnant they were already receiving medical care. Furthermore, it was suggested that women might be informed about the test so they could make their own decision about it; thus reducing pressure to take the test (KEMO 1992). The same point of view was voiced by the parents' organisation BOSK (BOSK 1992). The organisation wanted women of all ages to be informed about the test so they could decide for themselves. However, BOSK was concerned informed consent would not be guaranteed in case screening would be offered as part of a population screening programme; the free choice not to opt for abortion might be constrained through societal pressure. As we will discuss below, this distinction between offering and informing would become important in the next decade. The Minister, however, decided not to implement serum screening for Down syndrome in the early 1990s.\n\n\nTesting for reproductive issues versus population screening\n\nThe discussion on serum screening should be seen in the light of previous developments during the 1980s. As became clear in the discussions about the departmental report on the prevention of hereditary and congenital anomalies (Parliamentary documentation 1987(Parliamentary documentation -1988a, there was a strong consensus for government to keep its distance from prenatal genetic testing. In clinical genetic practice in the Netherlands, parental autonomy had been firmly established. It appeared that by then a 'field of argumentation' had developed regarding genetic testing for sensitive reproductive options. On the other hand, quite another field of argumentation had formed concerning population screening. There was consensus at the time that the instrument of population screening should be solely offered to improve public health if used for treatable disorders with an available early intervention. In short: no treatment, no screening. In this field of argumentation, the government should play an active role.\n\nPrenatal screening did not fit either of these two fields of argumentation, and in the decades to come in political and professional debates, a new field was constructed by alternatively borrowing and differentiating from the fields of argumentation of both prenatal testing and population screening. How this process works can, for instance, be seen by looking at the role of the government. Fear of governmental pressure, as well as societal pressure appeared in discussions on prenatal genetic screening. The very fact that the government would organise and offer screening was perceived as exerting pressure. This line of thinking was further elaborated in the report 'Genes and limits' published by the Scientific Institute of the Christian-democratic party, CDA, in 1992. This political party was influential because during the 1980s and first half of the 1990s it had formed coalition governments chaired by prime ministers from the CDA. The report expressed the Christian-democratic viewpoint on modern genetic technologies and stated:\n\n'Population screening is aimed at potential prevention or treatment of disease … in any case it may be perceived by citizens … that the government by allowing population screening, would find it important … to detect affected foetuses without prevention or treatment being available…' (Scientific Institute of the CDA 1992). Also, preconceptional carrier screening was not found to be acceptable as it would burden the future parents with uncertain knowledge, and would eventually lead to a decision on whether or not to become pregnant and continue that pregnancy or terminate it.\n\nFor the time being, reproductive issues were deemed to be safely in the hands of obstetricians and clinical geneticists in the case of elevated risk, such as advanced maternal age. Prenatal diagnostic testing was offered to women of and over 36 years of age. For this group in the 1990s, serum screening gradually became an option. Though serum screening might be used as an additional or better risk assessment instrument than maternal age, ethical concerns were considered too significant. For pregnant women in general, serum screening was unavailable during the 1990s, thereby precluding parental autonomy to choose screening (Weinans et al. 2000).\n\n\nNew regulation\n\nIn 1996, the Population Screening Act (WBO: Wet op het Bevolkingsonderzoek), debated for many years, finally came into force. The purpose of the Act was to protect people against potentially harmful screening. A special license was required to organise some forms of screening, such as population screening for disorders with no available treatment or prevention. For the latter, a licence would only be given in 'exceptional circumstances.' The Act underscored that treatability was a cornerstone of Dutch screening policy.\n\nThe Health Council of the Netherlands reflected on the new legal framework and the fact that prenatal screening would be subject to licensing in the absence of treatment or prevention. When discussing the legislator's viewpoint that pregnancy termination constituted neither treatment nor prevention, the committee stated that abortion nevertheless could be seen as an appropriate course of action, under the circumstances (Health Council of the Netherlands 1994, 76). Clinical geneticist Leo ten Kate, one of the Council committee members, later noted:\n\n'The committee considered that \"genetic screening should enable people to escape their fate by giving them the freedom to make an informed choice and adopt a chosen course of action which they regard as acceptable\"… By taking this position, the committee freed itself from the restrictive viewpoint of the legislature and formulated a set of criteria to be met by genetic screening programs' (Ten Kate 2000, 296). The Health Council report refined and elaborated earlier screening criteria, such as those by Wilson and Jungner (1968) and the Council of Europe (Committee of Ministers 1992). For our purpose, particularly the formulation of criteria 3 and 4 by the Health Council of the Netherlands (1994) are relevant:\n\n3. The purpose of the programme must be to enable the participants to determine the presence or the risk of a disorder or carrier status, and to take a decision on the basis of that information.\n\n\nPractical courses of action must be open to the participants.\n\nBy introducing a new focus on 'courses of action', a tension was created with the legal framework for population screening that insisted on 'treatment' as point of reference.\n\nBy explicitly restricting mass screenings to disorders for which a treatment was available, it was not clear what the consequences were for current practice of Down syndrome testing offered to pregnant women of and over 36 years. Since testing was perceived as individual health care, initially, it was expected to be exempt from licensing under the Population Screening Act. In 1996, however, it was agreed that testing based on maternal age should be considered as screening, since the test was not requested by an individual woman, but rather was offered to a specific group of women (Parliamentary Documentation 1995-1996. Because this kind of genetic testing by then had become standard practice, prenatal testing for Down syndrome for women of and over 36 years of age was granted a temporary licence.\n\n\nA new century\n\nAfter the turn of the century, developments in screening techniques, improvements in test characteristics, and a gradually rising interest in prenatal screening put the subject on the agenda again. For women of and over 36 years of age, it had become possible to have a serum screening test, women under 36 years of age could ask for one, which increased familiarity with prenatal screening. Having prenatal ultrasound screening 'for fun' became a new phenomenon that was discussed in women's magazines. Around the year 2000, pilots were conducted with nuchal translucency and serum screening (van den Berg et al. 2005). New technological options and the implications for policy were discussed in the 2001 Health Council report 'Prenatal Screening' and its 2004 follow-up 'Prenatal screening (2)' (Health Council of the Netherlands 2001Netherlands , 2004. In 2001, the Health Council reviewed several screening test methods. A triple test to be offered in the second trimester of pregnancy was considered as a suitable risk assessment screening for both Down syndrome and neural tube defects and should be aimed at all pregnant women, regardless of age. According to the Heath Council, when certain conditions were met, such as an adequate procedure for informed consent, risk assessment for Down syndrome would be 'such a superior alternative to the existing practice of maternal age-based screening that there should be no reason to delay its introduction any longer'. The Council argued that screening based on the triple test would lead to considerably fewer invasive tests and increased detection of Down syndrome pregnancies, while a far larger group would be allowed to benefit from having individual risk assessment. The introduction of screening for neural tube defects was considered a desirable step (Health Council of the Netherlands 2001, 28-29).\n\nAt the end of 2001, the Ministry of Health organised a Consultation round inviting several groups, such as obstetricians and patient representatives, to voice their opinions on serum screening (Toom and van Berkel 2003). In the same year, several obstetricians criticised the Health Council's report in a medical journal. An important point of contention was that the birth prevalence of Down syndrome was higher in the maternal age group over 36 years of age. According to these obstetricians, by setting an age limit, potential psychological harm from screening younger women could be prevented (Hamerlynck and Knuist 2001). Another argument was that test characteristics for the group of older women were better than for the group of younger women. The number of false negatives in women under 36 years of age was found unacceptably high: approximately half of the cases of Down syndrome in pregnancies of younger women would not be detected, thereby giving false reassurance. In addition, the false positives in the younger age group would require further testing. Based on figures from the Health Council, the obstetricians calculated that via invasive testing about the same number of cases of Down syndrome would be detected (115) as healthy foetuses would be lost because of test-induced iatrogenic abortions (111). Medicalisation of pregnancy was deemed undesirable (Kleiverda and Vervest 2001). The Health Council Committee had based its arguments on calculations for all age groups together. Representatives of the Committee responded by stating that compared to the current age-related diagnostic testing, the total number of invasive tests would drop. For the Committee, the option for women of all ages to consider a test was important (Van der Maas and Dondorp 2001) and was seen as a benefit, whereas the obstetricians stressed the burden of testing.\n\nOffer screening only to 36+ women?\n\nIn November 2003, the State Secretary of Health sent a letter with the government's reaction to the Health Council. In the statement, several arguments from previous years reappeared. The intention of the Population Screening Act to protect people against the potential drawbacks of screening was underscored. According to the State Secretary, the drawbacks of risk assessment screening for women under 36 years of age were considered greater than the benefits because their chance of having a foetus with Down syndrome was lower than for older women; medicalisation of childbirth for this group was to be avoided. Women over 36 years of age should be offered screening tests, as well as invasive diagnostic tests. If women under 36 years of age wanted a risk assessment test, they could ask and pay for it themselves. The State Secretary remarked that there were ample reasons to continue the restrained government policy regarding prenatal screening. She stated it confronts us with questions such as, whether medical framing of a natural process should be applied that 'hardly' raises problems for younger women, and that is seen by most of them as something positive; and whether this is a step towards a misleading ideal of a malleable humanity? (Parliamentary documentation 2003(Parliamentary documentation -2004a.\n\n\nThe danger of eugenics in population screening\n\nIn the arguments of the State Secretary and commentators, such as critical obstetricians, age limit surfaces as a watershed for population screening. In general, for population screening, benefit must outweigh harm (Wilson and Jungner 1968). The Health Council weighed the benefits of having the option to obtain risk assessment against potential harm for all pregnant women, whereas the State Secretary and critical obstetricians split pregnant women into subsets. When weighing pros and cons for younger women, it was thought that the balance would be uneven while they would suffer from the psychological burden whereas their group risk was relatively small. However, the figures may relate to a more fundamental principle. Pregnancy is seen as a natural phenomenon and medicalisation of pregnancy in the form of prenatal testing places pregnancy in a category of potential danger. A moral argument is added: the question whether we consider life to be malleable and appropriate for tinkering. Here, we find an echo of the fears of eugenics. Whereas testing in individual high risk cases is more or less accepted, on a population level, prenatal screening can cause discomfort. The fact that the government would organise screening added to that sentiment (as discussed in the section above). People might think that particular screening would be acceptable and advisable in the interest of public health. The government could avoid using the instrument of population screening by maintaining the age limit and not offering serum screening to all pregnant women. Restricting screening to women 36 or older would fit into the existing paradigm of providing genetic services to persons with an elevated risk. What is relevant from a democratic point of view is that the government then makes the decision for younger women who cannot decide for themselves whether to have the screening test or not.\n\n\nFreedom to take the screening test\n\nIn contrast to the discussion at the end of the 1980s, in the early 2000s, in Parliament and in the media, some critical questions were raised in response to the government's position. Especially problematic was the issue that women under 36 years of age had to ask for the test themselves, as the government was under no obligation to inform them of its availability nor was it possible to apply for reimbursement of the cost for the test. For women who lacked financial resources, had a lower education or a poor understanding of the Dutch language it would be difficult to have a test (Parliamentary documentation 2003(Parliamentary documentation -2004b. Also, a motion was brought forward urging the government to offer prenatal screening to all women (Parliamentary documentation 2003(Parliamentary documentation -2004c. In contrast to the reactions in the 1980s, when concerns were raised about whether women would have the option not to be tested, this time, in parts of society there were concerns about whether women would be able to have a test, if they wanted it.\n\nIn April 2004, the Health Council produced an updated report on prenatal screening (Health Council of the Netherlands 2004) and again suggested abandoning the age limit. They now suggested performing a combination test for Down syndrome in the first trimester-a blood test and a nuchal translucency measurement by ultrasound. For neural tube defects, an ultrasound test in the second trimester would be preferred.\n\nThe State Secretary of Health responded to this new advice and to the critical questions regarding her letter explaining the government's stand on the previous Health Council report on prenatal screening. She argued that based on new test developments giving information to all pregnant women on risk assessment tests by now was self-evident. However, women should have the option not to be informed if they did not want to. It should be made clear to women that they could reject screening, what the consequences of having a risk assessment test could be, and what further actions could take place in case of a positive outcome. Then, the woman could reflect on whether she would want to enter that trajectory at all. The restrained policy was continued, as was the age limit. It was argued that for women under 36 years of age, the risk of having a child with Down syndrome was lower, and the test would have more false positive and false negative outcomes than for the group who were 36 years of age or older. It was reiterated that it was not the aim to detect as many abnormalities as possible. Parents of children with Down syndrome or someone having Down syndrome should never be questioned as to why there had not been prenatal screening. For neural tube defects, the possibility of performing an ultrasound in the second trimester was studied further as recommended. The Health Council had suggested doing so, and representatives of obstetricians and midwives had urged to introduce this screening routinely, among others to strengthen the quality of standard care (Commissie Verloskunde 2003). Compared to the end of the 1980s, now there was support among health care professionals for prenatal screening for neural tube defects.\n\nNo treatment, no screening?\n\nWe would like to argue that these new policy developments in prenatal screening for Down syndrome and neural tube defects marked a shift from an emphasis on treatability and collective protection against harm by banning screening. Instead, offering options has moved to the fore as suggested in 1994 by the Health Council. Women are now given a choice, based on adequate information, to screen or not to screen for disorders in their foetus for which no treatment (in the sense of cure) is available. However, currently, prenatal screening for Down syndrome is not offered as part of an official population screening programme to women of all ages. The information on the screening is provided to all women, but women under 36 years of age have to pay for the screening themselves.\n\nTo complicate the picture, a second trimester screening, the standard anomaly scan (SEO: Structureel Echoscopisch Onderzoek), was introduced in 2007. It is offered to all pregnant women and reimbursed. Interestingly, this anomaly scan can detect both treatable conditions, such as certain cardiac anomalies, as well as untreatable conditions, such as severe neural tube defects. The character of the technology has made maintaining the strict separation between the field of argumentation of population screening for health purposes on the one hand and the field of argumentation of genetic testing for untreatable disorders on the other hand problematic. 3 By introducing this screening, in fact, a new standard integrating elements of both fields of argumentation is developing.\n\nAlthough the standard anomaly scan does not resolve the conflicting aims of improving a foetus' health outcome versus gaining information about a possibly untreatable disorder as a basis for reproductive options, the woman or couple can decide whether or not to have the screening test. Much attention is paid to providing women with adequate information about risk assessment testing, as well as the option to decide not be informed or not to have the screen. For Down syndrome screening, web-based decision aids have been developed (Raats et al. 2008;Meijer et al. 2010). This level of pretest information and counselling echoes the principle of informed choice in clinical genetics.\n\n\nNew trends\n\nSince the 1980s, not only have techniques been developed that made it possible to screen an increasing number of pregnant women for a growing number of disorders, but public knowledge on and a demand for genetic testing has also increased. Another development has been the introduction of commercial testing. In the Netherlands, at the end of the 1990s, commercial companies started to offer so-called 'ultrasounds for fun', making it possible to have intrauterine pictures of the foetus. The fact that foetal anomalies were occasionally detected in the presence of parents who had not received any counselling was an extra impetus to regulate screening. Although a range of genetic tests is currently offered on the internet (Borry et al. 2010), until now prenatal testing has been predominantly offered via established centres of health care. However, the trend for commercialisation also implies that the 'old' governmental policy of not offering screening as a way to protect people against potential harm is becoming obsolete. If certain tests are not offered by the government, people may arrange to have testing in other, perhaps commercial, centres or hospitals in other countries, or via the internet.\n\n\nConclusion and discussion: Individual versus collective effects\n\nIn this new era, the individual woman or couple has gained more options to make an informed choice of whether or not to have reproductive screening. In principle, the availability of high-quality testing and the ability to make an informed choice might be welcomed as a positive aspect of presentday health care in modern democracies.\n\nAt the same time, it is relevant to note that individual choices add up to a collective effect: reproductive screening may become an increasingly 'normal' thing to do. Even if societal pressure is not explicit, implicit norms, comments and expectations from friends and family may frame the choices individuals can make. The sum of the individual choices may result in a 'collective eugenics' as visible in the number of screening tests being performed and in the reduction of the live births of foetuses with serious disorders that can be detected prenatally.\n\nThis mechanism, which is a cause for unease, can be demonstrated in other reproductive testing, such as Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) and will certainly surface again when new free foetal DNA testing is considered.\n\nIn the Netherlands, in 2008, PGD became the focal point of a public debate and almost caused the downfall of the Cabinet (Huijer 2009). PGD had been applied rather unproblematically on a very small scale, for a handful of couples with a high risk of serious disorders in their offspring. When the government prepared new regulation of this practice, a public debate ensued in newspapers and on the television, among other things, over the question of whether disorders that are not fully penetrant, such as hereditary breast cancer, would also be eligible for PGD. Although patient groups, ethicists, and newspaper commentators, for instance, in the liberal newspaper NRC (NRC 2008), pleaded for this application pointing to the severity and high penetrance of the disorder, most notably representatives of Christian political parties and Christian patient groups called for a ban on this type of testing, arguing for the right to life and against eugenic tendencies (e.g. Kuiper 2008). Issues of (expected) scale figured anew as did the notion of the democratic right to make an informed choice (depicted as opposed to a 'religiously ordained' morale).\n\nWhenever new technological options in prenatal testing become available, debate is called for to discuss the social and ethical ramifications. Especially, the tension between individual choice and the collective effects of creating a society without room for handicaps or illness, as a new form of collective eugenics, reappears. In the light of this tension, we would like to draw upon our Dutch historical case study to discuss the role of the government and public debate. Evidently, the role and responsibilities of the government have changed during the years. Instead of banning screening that was found to be unsound and was perceived to have negative societal consequences, the government increasingly has taken up the responsibility to implement new forms of reliable reproductive testing and screening in an ethically sound manner, for instance, by providing adequate information and enabling informed choice, thereby changing the notion of protection. In addition, continuing efforts are necessary to boost the quality of testing and personnel performing the test. It is vital that policy should be in place to ensure standards of care for the handicapped, in order for people to have a real choice of whether to have testing or not, an issue that had already been raised in an earlier Health Council of the Netherlands (1989) report.\n\nIn modern democracies, public debate is essential for discussing values and practices implicated by governmental policy. It should be possible to voice a range of arguments for or against screening, and shed light on the mixed blessings and complexities involved (see also Huijer (2009)). Until recently, both human geneticists and bioethicists have (rightfully) stressed the importance of taking the individual as a focal point when considering genetic testing. Given the recurrent argument of collective eugenics, public debate might be used to reflect on the ramifications of individual choice. Debate has just started on the host of ethical issues involved in whole genome sequencing, including sequencing of foetal DNA. Aside from the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the data, issues include determining what information to report to parents and the right of the future child not to know its genetic makeup (Health Council of the Netherlands 2010; de Jong et al. 2010). Though this debate still seems confined to small groups of experts, the expected advent of free foetal DNA testing will soon open this debate to a wider audience. If or when such testing becomes a reality, the experiences with the standard anomaly scan might hold important lessons as to the difficulties in counselling and guiding parental reaction to information that may not always be conclusive about the nature of the suspected anomaly. In popular literature, accounts of how to deal with prenatal screening and foetal anomaly scan information, and how to live with the difficult decisions based on that information are appearing (Slagboom 2011). For societal actors, enriching public debate may entail discussing concepts and accounts of living with or without impairments and assimilating genetic information about oneself or one's offspring. These concepts change over time and instead of a 'collective eugenics', we might be able to discuss and produce new collective, yet varying images of 'the good life'.\n The publisher, Profil Verlag, Munchen/Wien, has given permission to reproduce parts of this book chapter.2  The choice for this focus was inspired by the Genetics and Democracy series organised in Lund, Sweden, where part of this paper was presented on October 5, 2009.\nJ Community Genet (2012) 3:79-89\nSpeaking of untreatable disorders in several cases is or has become questionable, and it would be better to regard these disorders as treatable 'to a lesser extent'. Recent advances in medication and care have made a significant contribution to boosting quality of life and life expectancy by tackling some aspects of the phenotype or co-morbidity.\nAcknowledgement This research was performed as part of the project 'Reshaping criteria for screening in the age of genomics' from the research programme of the Centre for Society and Genomics, in collaboration with the Centre for Medical Systems Biology.
